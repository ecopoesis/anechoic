				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/466878269-e1391603917581.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-100469" alt="Missouri v Florida" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/466878269-e1391603917581.jpg?w=658&#038;h=369"   /></a></p>
<p><em>In case you were busy hearing wild thirdhand stories about Joe Torre&#8217;s hard-partying lifestyle in the 1970s, here&#8217;s what you missed in sports on Tuesday:</em></p>
<p>• Chris Walker made his Gators&#8217; debut, and Michael Frazier II hit four second-half 3-pointers as <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400506402" target="_blank">Florida held off a feisty Missouri team, 68-58</a>, to remain perfect in SEC play. &#8220;I&#8217;m all about those tossed salads and scrambled eggs, oh my,&#8221; Frazier II explained after the game. &#8220;But that&#8217;s quite literally the only thing I have in common with the fictional psychiatrist Frasier Crane, so please stop asking me about him. Good night everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>• Steve Nash&#8217;s return for Los Angeles was not enough as the Lakers <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400489595" target="_blank">fell to the Minnesota Timberwolves, 109-99</a>. Although the Lakers dropped to 16-32 with the loss, team vice-president Jim Buss remained upbeat, saying, &#8220;We lose now, we win later. Wink. I have a handshake deal with a certain David Stern. Wink. Let&#8217;s just say that everyone else will be playing Ping-Pong, but we&#8217;ll be playing table tennis. Wink.&#8221; However, when Buss was told that Stern was no longer the NBA commissioner, rendering any under-the-table dealings moot, a tense silence hung in the room for a good three minutes before Buss yelled, &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you winking? For god&#8217;s sake, wink!&#8221;</p>
<p>• The Atlanta Braves <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10403089/freddie-freeman-atlanta-braves-agree-contract-extension" target="_blank">signed All-Star first baseman Freddie Freeman through 2021</a> with a deal worth at least $125 million. More like Freddie NOT-Freeman, am I right? Am I? I am, aren&#8217;t I? They&#8217;re totally paying him money to play baseball. This is just like when shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt stole so much money from the teams he played for that he had to go to court, and then bet his entire salary in Vegas to raise enough money to pay off his extensive legal bills. Classic Bet-in-court. I was totally right about that also.</p>
<p>• Richard Sherman revealed that his Seahawks defense <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/10403077/super-bowl-richard-sherman-claims-seattle-seahawks-anticipated-denver-broncos-plays-based-peyton-manning-hands" target="_blank">was able to decipher Peyton Manning&#8217;s hand signals</a> at the line of scrimmage during Super Bowl XLVIII, giving his team a crucial edge in what turned out to be a lopsided battle between the league&#8217;s top defense and top offense. Sherman went on to say that his team was vulnerable if Manning had implemented new route concepts in his audible packages. As a Seahawks fan, I would like to say, Richard, this time you went too far with your talk. We play the Broncos next year, potentially in the first game! Shhhhhhh! When asked what happened, say, &#8220;We got lucky to win with magic!&#8221; Don&#8217;t say exactly what you did to gain an edge and how that edge could be overcome! Come on, man.</p>
<p>• 34-year-old former NBA star Tracy McGrady is going to try to follow in Michael Jordan&#8217;s footsteps <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10404273/former-nba-star-tracy-mcgrady-try-baseball" target="_blank">as he pursues a minor league baseball career</a> in the wake of his retirement from professional basketball. However, this story has some details that are making me deeply suspicious. Namely, Tracy McGrady is not 34. Nope. Not possible. I&#8217;m not even going to look it up. And you shouldn&#8217;t either. Let&#8217;s all just agree that Tracy McGrady cannot be 34 and move on forever.</p>
<p>• Tuukka Rask made 27 saves as the Boston Bruins <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=400485087" target="_blank">beat the reeling Vancouver Canucks, 3-1</a>. &#8220;Rask! Rask! Rask!&#8221; Rask explained after the game when asked what he thought was causing the Canucks&#8217; current woes. Fortunately, Rask&#8217;s recently assigned interpreter was able to translate&#8217;s Rask&#8217;s answer as &#8220;Rask! Rask! Rask!&#8221;</p>
<p>• Texas overcame some first-half struggles before Jonathan Holmes powered a resilient Longhorns team <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400498381" target="_blank">to a 59-54 win over TCU</a>. The win was Texas&#8217;s seventh in a row, so allow me to unironically tip my cap to Rick Barnes and his team for a strong start to the Big 12 season. Hold on &#8230; man, this is hard &#8230; my brain is sending signals to my wrist, but my wrist just can&#8217;t do it &#8230; come on &#8230; sorry guys, everything in my body is rejecting this gesture &#8230; oh, it&#8217;s happening &#8230; tipping &#8230; tipping &#8230; there it is: an official tip of the cap to Rick Barnes. Now if you&#8217;ll all excuse me, I need to take a long, cold shower.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100467&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[People didn't love that Wizards team because they played the right way. They loved them precisely because they played the wrong way, and in that wrongness came moments of absolute, reality-defying pleasure<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100342&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The time was Halloween night, 2009. The place was Washington, D.C. Gilbert Arenas had just scored 32 points to lead the Wizards to a victory over the New Jersey Nets. The players, both in the sense of the athletes taking part in the game and the actors in this historically significant American drama, included the following: Chris Douglas-Roberts, Yi Jianlian, and Rafer Alston for the Nets. The Wizards? Dressing for the Wiz that night were the aforementioned Agent Zero, JaVale McGee, Andray Blatche, Nick Young, and Randy Foye. That&#8217;s the coach-killer Beatles right there. And this, this night was their <em>Ed Sullivan Show</em> performance.</p>
<p>It would take the Washington professional basketball team four and a half years to have a winning percentage as good what they had that night. The mood in the locker room after the game that night had both a fin de siècle and beginning de siècle feel. Maybe it was a beginning de fin de siècle. Things can get pretty fluid when you&#8217;re talking about a team with DeShawn Stevenson on it.</p>
<p>Arenas&#8217;s 32 was his second 30-or-more-point game in the first three contests of the season. But it was Blatche who was under the spotlight. He scored 30 points in 28 minutes on 15-of-18 shooting. Basketball-Reference heads write songs about nights like that. The Wizards, then 2-1, were stunting. About Blatche, Brendan Haywood said, &#8220;If he does the interview with shades on, I&#8217;m leaving!&#8221;</p>
<p>This team, though, was really all about Gil. Just look at the highlights from that era, like this montage of Agent Zero 2009-10 highlights set to Kanye&#8217;s &#8220;Stronger&#8221; …</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/VYLkbahEOh0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>I mean, come on. Obviously, peak Gilbert is  2005-07. A knee injury forced him to miss most of the 2007-08 and 2008-09 seasons. This was his comeback, and he came out of the gates with a battery in his back. I asked Joe House, one of our two resident Wizards fans, what he remembered about this ’09 team and he wrote me back this torn-from-the-pages-of-a–<em>Downton Abbey–</em>script missive:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The 2009-10 team that WAS SO LOADED THAT FUCKFACE ERNIE CLUELESS GRUNFELD GAVE AWAY THE 5TH OVERALL PICK IN THE DRAFT FOR RANDY FOYE &amp; MIKE MILLER. SO that team was the tipping point for the super-familiar cycle here in DC of a poorly constructed, ill-conceived group built around a flawed premise (i.e., that Gil&#8217;s return from injury would feature a quick reestablishment of Agent Zero) inflated by unrealistic expectations and ill-founded hope that ended approximately 30 games into the season with Finga Gunz, an episode so ridiculous and cliched that no one would be dumb enough to imagine it as fiction.  #SOFUCKINGWIZARDS</p>
<p>I also asked Sharp, our other Wiz fan. He simply said &#8220;2005-2009, nobody was on the Wizards&#8217; level. That was the team that made me love the NBA forever.&#8221; Sharp isn&#8217;t allowed to write about the Wizards because when he does, bad things happen to Bradley Beal. But his sentiment, even as a Wizards fan, isn&#8217;t that unique. For a lot of people, that Wiz team, with all those characters, was the subject of a crazy, screwed-up love affair. The kind of relationship where you find yourself standing outside on your porch, locked out of your house in your underwear, and you have no idea how it happened and you can&#8217;t wait to do it again the next night.</p>
<p>People didn&#8217;t love that Wizards team because they played the right way. They loved them precisely because they played the wrong way, and in that wrongness came moments of absolute, reality-defying pleasure. Like, JaVale McGee is not supposed to be able to go coast-to-coast and flush like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://i.minus.com/iVZYDNPeKpnK8.gif" width="576" height="324" /></p>
<p>But there he is! And it&#8217;s like watching a pterodactyl play saxophone! Nobody really cared about wins and losses with these guys. They were pure entertainment; basketball for (usually bad) basketball&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>Of course, this all ended very, very badly. As House alluded to, there were various incidents, off the court, that effectively ended Gilbert&#8217;s career. Once he returned to the league, after his suspension, Arenas was decent, but he was never Agent Zero. And the Wizards were never the Wiz again.</p>
<p>This current team, led by John Wall and Bradley Beal, has some players. My feelings for John Wall are pretty well-documented, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if his exclusion from the U.S. national team plunges this country into an emotional, if not financial, depression. This is the first time the Wizards have a winning record in Wall&#8217;s career, and I hope he and Washington keep one for a long time to come. I genuinely like guys like Jan Vesely and Marcin Gortat. And Trevor Ariza remains one of the more underrated guys in the Eastern Conference. They have players, but they don&#8217;t have characters. It&#8217;s not the same thing as the team having character. I know there&#8217;s been a knucklehead purge in Washington over the last few seasons. And most of these guys, superficially, seem to have their heads screwed on right. That kind of thing is important. I like these guys. But as they slowly start to put it together, I couldn&#8217;t help but remember the inglorious bastards from that 2009 team. That was a team that I loved.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100342&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Late last year, I took a trip out to Portland, Oregon, to see the Adidas factory, just as they were unveiling their plans for the World Cup. While there I took some time to interview Ernesto Bruce, head of Adidas in North America. In particular, I wanted to talk about the relationship the company has historically had with Major League Soccer, as one of the first big companies to adopt a high-profile partnership with the league — and in particular the development of Generation Adidas, the company-sponsored program for promising young players in MLS. Several of this year’s GA players are currently enjoying their first full week’s training with their new clubs as preseason gets under way, so now seemed a good time to revisit this conversation.</em></p>
<p>I started by asking Bruce about the company’s history with MLS.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been a partner of MLS since its inception,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It started off with us partnering with three teams: Columbus Crew, D.C. United, and Kansas City. When we started out, there were obviously a lot of different sponsors in play, and in 2005 we made a push to partner with the whole league — to be an all-league sponsor … Strategically, 2005, going into the 2006 World Cup, we went all-league. We outfitted all the teams, and it was a substantial investment that we decided to make because we felt, one, that it would move the game forward, and two, we saw long-term opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The business opportunity really wasn’t there until further down the line. The immediate opportunity was that we could work with MLS to restructure the landscape in the U.S. It really wasn’t working. It was very, very segmented. You had youth clubs developing players in a certain way; you had colleges developing them in a certain way; you then had the national team with their way; you had different coaching licenses; you had the NSCAA; you had the U.S. Federation.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>And then there was you …</b></p>
<p>We were in that game. It was a mess. The national team had not been performing. So from our lens of partnering with some of the world’s best federations, we said, &#8220;This needs to change — the country needs to change.&#8221; And it needed to start to go in a way of the professional teams in the U.S. should be the ones developing the players for the national team.</p>
<p>So that was 2005, and by the aftermath of the 2010 World Cup, the landscape had already started to change. The MLS clubs were becoming more and more relevant. ESPN came in and did the ESPN deal with MLS, so in 2010 we sat down with MLS again and said, &#8220;Let’s redo our deal. We want to pump more investment into it, and we want to move more of that investment into player development and building up the league.&#8221; So we put more financial backing into the marketing and the player development side. MLS youth academies started coming into play in 2010. The MLS commissioner mandated that each club have two youth teams, so again, that wasn’t part of our original deal, but we wanted to make sure that we outfitted and supported those two teams. And that’s where we are today.</p>
<p><b>For all that Adidas focuses on an international perspective and you’ve talked about partnerships with other federations, you also run Generation Adidas, and it’s a model that’s very particular to the American game.</b></p>
<p>Generation Adidas is truly meant to work within the U.S. model, which is that college has a huge amount of value in the U.S. In other countries, you want to become a professional player — that’s it. That’s your payday, that’s your dream, to become a professional player. Here, education has a tremendous amount of value. Here, you want to play, hopefully become a professional, but really in the back of your head you’re going, <em>I need a college education so I can get a job in case my leg gets broken.</em> So we said, let’s start a program that will essentially pay for their college education.</p>
<p>So, one, we gave [players] roster protection. That means you don’t count against the salary cap, which means that now you go on to a three-year contract, and now you can go into it with a clear mindset and say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got three years to develop. I can continue my education within that window.&#8221; Some of those guys have done it, they’ve either taken night school, or if for some reason you decide not to play or you’ve had a career-ending injury, you can still get your degree and we will pay for it. A weight is lifted off the players and, probably most importantly, a weight is lifted off the parents. The parents can now push their kids and say, &#8220;Go be a pro. We support you.&#8221; Versus what we hear a lot of kids talk about when we approach them, which is, &#8220;Oh no — my parents — I have to have a college education.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>So when did you begin seeing the model working?</b></p>
<p>I look at a Jozy Altidore. Jozy was a young kid on the U-17 national team, and he had a choice to make. I remember being in on those conversations with Jozy and his family, and for them it was an easy decision. They said, &#8220;Wait, our kid can still get an education? Wait, you guys will pay for his education and he has the opportunity to become a professional player, and he won’t get cut after three months or six months?&#8221; &#8220;No, because we believe in him and he shows the potential.&#8221; They signed up right away and it’s paid off … But now for him to be doing what he’s doing on the national team is what we all envisioned.</p>
<p><b>And the point at which we see significant professional input on a player’s development happening is getting earlier and earlier, right?</b></p>
<p>What evolved from Generation Adidas is [our support for] the homegrown player. It protects the team to invest in those younger players, because then they won’t lose them. So they can tag them as a homegrown player and say, &#8220;We’ll invest in you. We’ll pay for all your travel, We’ll pay for all your academy, we’ll maybe even pay for your education in some cases.&#8221; Toronto FC, for example, have an education program.</p>
<p>For us it’s a great investment. It’s a pretty even split between Adidas and MLS. The league may pay the player’s salary; we’ll then supplement that with college education. We market the program fairly heavily, we take the kids on an international trip, and part of that salary is funded through our investment in the league as a whole.</p>
<p>They’re the future. And the unfortunate thing, and why we believe in MLS so wholeheartedly, is that youth clubs and colleges are not developing players to become professional players. They’re developing players to win trophies. And that doesn’t mean they’re developing players; they’re developing <em>teams</em> to win a trophy. So that defeats the purpose of player development because you’re not developing individuals, you’re developing a team. It’s not to say that they don’t have a place in the landscape, but MLS can fast-track this in a whole new way.</p>
<p><b>But is there a sense that you end up developing a more sophisticated farm system for players to leave for Europe rather than developing the game in the U.S.?</b></p>
<p>Jozy. I … secretly, I want him back. I think having a player like that, who’s had international experience, to have Jozy come back into MLS, sends a message to young kids. It says: &#8220;Become a pro. If the opportunity presents itself you can go and have an experience abroad, but MLS is just as good, if not better, or different, than any other league in the world. Don’t come back here when you’re at the end of the road.&#8221; I’m not as excited about that, but I think if Jozy, say, were to come back in his prime it sends a huge message.</p>
<p><b>Those meaningful local connections, not just to the U.S. and Canada, but to specific cities and specific soccer scenes, are vitally important for the future, aren’t they?</b></p>
<p>I think the minute a kid from your hometown comes up through that system, when he shows up on the field, you automatically, one, root for him, two, you support him, and three, now you fall in love with that team. You go, <em>That kid grew up in my neighborhood</em>. When Jozy was playing for the Red Bulls, he was <i>loved</i>. He left, and when that kid comes back some day, if he ever plays for the Red Bulls again, that stadium will go nuts. He’ll connect with so many followers.</p>
<p><b>And then those kids grow up and take the field themselves …</b></p>
<p>Those moments take time. It’s now getting to that tipping point where those young kids that were going to the matches are now playing. The players that have now graduated out of MLS are having kids and now you start to build a legacy, now you start to build an inheritance. I grew up in South America. I grew up playing. In the back of our heads, our dream was to play for Chelsea, Real Madrid, Liverpool. We watched Champions League for that, and we were like, &#8220;Can you imagine ever playing for one of those teams?&#8221; But we didn’t have in our mindset, <em>I want to play for MY club</em>. Instead, we all wanted play for University of Portland. So that’s part of the landscape that’s definitely beginning to change.</p>
<p>Now you go into those markets — and we do a lot of focus groups — we show kids product, we talk to them and ask them who their favorite player is, who their favorite team is. Two years ago, 90 percent of those kids were telling us international clubs. You go into an MLS market now, and you ask those kids their favorite team, 60 percent of those kids have already switched. They’re saying that their favorite club is their local MLS club: Sporting Kansas City, Columbus Crew, Portland Timbers, you name it. It’s really starting to now turn, because those kids are playing through that youth academy system, and more importantly the guy that they’re playing with didn’t get a scholarship to some great school, they got drafted and they’re showing up in MLS on ESPN. Now that hunger starts to come to life.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100217&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Our National Signing Day 2014 Primer answers that and more.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100140&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow is National Signing Day, which is basically college football’s version of a draft. A bunch of overly caffeinated coaches will spend the day hovering around their fax machines, anxiously awaiting signed letters of intent. Solid verbals will become binding commitments, message boards will become cyber-havens for anonymous middle-aged men to lob personal attacks at teenagers, and <a href="https://twitter.com/TomLuginbill" target="_blank">ESPNU’s Tom Luginbill</a> will become a full-blown vampire. In other words, it will be the best day on the college football calendar that doesn’t involve any actual football.</p>
<p>Will certain five-star prospects ultimately fail to live up to the hype? Will a blue-chipper eventually get kicked out of his school of choice for stealing a laptop and wind up starring at Auburn instead? Well, yes and yes. Does that make Signing Day any less exciting or devastating, depending on your preferred team’s fortunes? Absolutely, positively not! To that end, here&#8217;s a primer to help you experience NSD 2014 like a seasoned recruitnik. Enjoy!</p>
<p><i>Note: Team and player rankings reflect <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/" target="_blank">ESPN RecruitingNation’</a>s lists as of Tuesday morning.</i></p>
<h2>1. Is Alabama’s Two-Game Losing Streak Hurting Its Recruiting Efforts?</h2>
<p>The Crimson Tide are currently in the midst of a two-game losing streak that&#8217;s going to last eight months. It&#8217;s disgraceful. Just think: <i>Southern Miss</i> has experienced the thrill of victory more recently than Bama, and the Golden Eagles went 1-11 last season. Paul Finebaum has offered radio-dispensed therapy for many in Tuscaloosa, and you don&#8217;t even want to know how Harvey Updyke is coping. And yet, surprise, surprise: Bama boasts ESPN’s top-ranked class, because the world is an inherently unfair place bent on SEC elitism. That’s life.</p>
<p>Nick Saban has already locked up <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/playerrankings/_/view/rn300/sort/rank/class/2014" target="_blank">a third of the nation&#8217;s five-star talent</a>, including left tackle Cameron Robinson, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKKrpV7i-10" target="_blank">whose highlight package</a> resembles an all-you-can-eat special at Denny’s: pancakes, pancakes, and more pancakes. Defensive end Da’Shawn Hand is more of a lunch guy, seeing as he made the most important decision of his life <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/highschools/woodbridge-standout-dashawn-hand-commits-to-alabama-over-michigan-florida/2013/11/14/1a9fa14a-4d78-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html" target="_blank"><i>at a freaking Wendy’s</i></a>. Cornerbacks (<a href="http://www.al.com/alabamafootball/index.ssf/2014/01/who_won_foot_race_between_alab.html" target="_blank">and close friends</a>) Tony Brown and Marlon Humphrey will ensure that Bama’s secondary remains a Revis Island outpost for years to come — except against A&amp;M, of course. And lest you doubt Saban’s demonic powers, consider that RB/“athlete” Bo Scarbrough was all set to make an <a href="http://www.stateoftheu.com/2014/1/31/5348312/miami-hurricanes-recruiting-radar-the-final-push" target="_blank">official visit to Miami this past weekend</a>, but then “<a href="https://twitter.com/MASSonJOX/status/429411389715664896" target="_blank">met with Coach Saban</a>” and “changed his mind.” Likely story.</p>
<h2>2. Has Texas A&amp;M Found an Heir Apparent for Johnny Manziel?</h2>
<p>It has indeed: The Aggies have a commitment from Kyle Allen, who happens to be the top-ranked pro-style quarterback prospect in the country according to ESPN and the top overall QB according to Rivals.com. No pressure, dude. You’re only the centerpiece of A&amp;M’s second-ranked, <a href="https://twitter.com/skhanjr/statuses/400322838545985536" target="_blank">SwagCopter-aided</a> recruiting class. I bet the Aggies faithful will be very understanding if you fail to win the Heisman next year. It’s not like they already named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Field" target="_blank">their field</a> after you or anything.</p>
<p>As for Allen’s off-field persona, folks hoping for JFF 2.0 will be saddened to learn that Allen does not <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2014/2/3/5375680/johnny-manziel-and-drake-wear-sweatshirts-of-each-other" target="_blank">hang out with Drake</a> or <a href="http://thebiglead.com/2012/11/05/johnny-manziel-was-scooby-doo-for-halloween-and-these-blondes-seemed-to-like-it/" target="_blank">wear Scooby-Doo costumes</a> or <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000218329/article/johnny-manziel-overslept-at-manning-passing-academy" target="_blank">skive off at the Manning Passing Academy</a>. Moreover, as a traditional pocket passer with only “<a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/158119/kyle-allen" target="_blank">adequate-to-good mobility</a>,” Allen doesn’t even resemble Manziel <i>on</i> the field. Hey, the Ryan Tannehill era wasn’t so bad!</p>
<h2>3. Is Leonard Fournette the Next Adrian Peterson?</h2>
<p>Decide for yourself:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/1YiiFKr2MGs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Fournette, a New Orleans native and <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/evaluation/_/id/168066/leonard-fournette" target="_blank">ESPN’s top overall prospect</a>, has opted to stay in-state and attend LSU, essentially making him the anti–Joe McKnight, which is about the highest compliment one can pay to an elite running back prospect. Fournette <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/highschool/2014/01/02/leonard-fournette-commits-lsu-allusa-team/4294103/" target="_blank">plans on becoming the first true freshman to ever win the Heisman</a>, and with Zach Mettenberger and Jeremy Hill off to the NFL, the Tigers’ offense could very well run through Fournette next season.</p>
<p>Plus, if you follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_fournette" target="_blank">Fournette on Twitter</a>, you know that he’s the leader of #BugaNation, which appears to be some sort of secret society that will, in all likelihood, take over the world by 2015. They may practice voodoo, <a href="https://twitter.com/T2J2Davis/status/430045376868286464" target="_blank">and they are <i>very</i> into their hand signal</a>. FEAR BUGA NATION.</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p><a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23Geaux" title="#Geaux">#Geaux</a> Buga Nation !!!&mdash; <br />Les Miles (@LSUCoachMiles) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/LSUCoachMiles/status/413523595516575744' data-datetime='2013-12-19T04:18:02+00:00'>December 19, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>4. What Does Urban Meyer Value Above All Else in His Recruits?</h2>
<p>Big butts. <a href="http://247sports.com/Article/Raekwon-McMillan-diary-talks-Urban-Meyer-Nick-Saban-and-more-131712" target="_blank">Seriously</a>. In a journal entry for 247Sports last May, five-star linebacker and Ohio State commit Raekwon McMillan wrote, “Of all the head coaches recruiting me, I&#8217;d say Urban Meyer is probably the funniest. He calls me ‘Bubble.’ That&#8217;s because he said I have a linebacker butt. I have a wide butt with a great leg base. Every time we talk, he calls me that.” Good to know! Meyer also told McMillan that former Florida legends Tim Tebow, Brandon Spikes, and Percy Harvin were great because of their “huge butts and great strength bases there.”</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/MobfYnRRpys?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Say what you will about Meyer’s ass-tastic recruiting strategy, but it’s definitely working. Ohio State’s sixth-ranked class is versatile, fast, and destined to widen the gap between the Buckeyes and everybody else in the Big Ten. It&#8217;s practically unheard of for in-state talent to spurn OSU for other top-tier programs, and the Glenville pipeline, which brought studs like Ted Ginn, Donte Whitner, and Troy Smith to Columbus a decade ago, has officially been restored thanks to commitments from four-stars Marshon Lattimore (athlete) and Erick Smith (safety).</p>
<p>Still, it’s Meyer’s ability to poach elite prospects from SEC country that really sets this class apart from its B1G counterparts. In fact, the only Big Ten class that’s even remotely close to OSU’s is Michigan’s, which ESPN currently ranks 12th. With scholarship numbers tight in Ann Arbor, the group is only 16 strong, but it includes cornerback Jabrill Peppers, the nation&#8217;s no. 2 overall prospect. Peppers announced his decision to attend Michigan back in May via free verse. It was a moving spectacle.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/xQusK1WK1rY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h2>5. How Are the New Head Coaches Faring on the Recruiting Trail?</h2>
<p>Being a new head coach on the recruiting trail is like transferring to a new high school a month before prom, and that’s why new head coaches tend to deliver fairly mediocre debut classes. Some try to salvage the situation by convincing the prospects they recruited to their old schools to jump ship with them, which is <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2014/01/31/vanderbilt-football-recruiting-james-franklin-penn-state/5082119/" target="_blank">exactly what ex-Vandy boss James Franklin has done</a> to keep Penn State’s class afloat. More importantly for Franklin: Four-star pro-style quarterback Michael O’Connor, <a href="http://tracking.si.com/2014/01/03/michael-oconnor-penn-state-enrollment/" target="_blank">who considered reopening his recruitment</a> after Bill O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s departure, liked the Franklin hire and promptly enrolled at PSU. Like Christian Hackenberg, O’Connor is a 6-foot-5 behemoth with underrated mobility and impeccable accuracy. Barring a Hackenberg injury, we won’t get to see O&#8217;Connor play anytime soon, but <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/evaluation/_/id/172118/michael-oconnor" target="_blank">ESPN’s scouting report</a> assures us that he’ll be “a fun guy to track.”</p>
<p>Charlie Strong’s <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/college-football-recruiting/2014/1/27/5351936/texas-longhorns-recruiting-chris-nelson-otaro-alaka-kollin-hill" target="_blank">had a tougher time</a> keeping his first class together at Texas, which isn&#8217;t so surprising considering someone as <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/24238783/photo-kevin-sumlin-in-attendance-at-a-drake-concert" target="_blank">effortlessly cool</a> as Kevin Sumlin is recruiting in Strong&#8217;s backyard. Texas fans will tolerate <i>one</i> middle-of-the-road class as Strong gets his feet wet in Austin, but he won&#8217;t hear any &#8220;good job, good effort!&#8221; chants if he lands the nation&#8217;s no. 14 class again next year. Also worth noting: Mack Brown (who’s still a university employee!) <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/24428379/recruit-mack-brown-told-texas-commitments-to-look-around" target="_blank">is NOT helping matters in the least</a>.</p>
<p>In a truly shocking turn of events, new/old Louisville coach Bobby Petrino seems to be having trouble convincing recruits and their parents that he’s a “changed man” who&#8217;s committed to Louisville — and to good behavior — for the long haul. <a href="http://college-football.si.com/2014/01/24/louisville-cardinals-recruiting-national-signing-day/" target="_blank">Prospects are dumping the Cardinals left and right</a>, and it’s unlikely that Petrino’s first class will finish in ESPN’s top 40.</p>
<p>Steve Sarkisian is having a slightly better go of it at USC, but his class is nothing to write home about … yet. With a number of top uncommitted prospects still considering USC, Signing Day could prove especially pivotal for the Trojans.</p>
<h2>6. Can Anyone or Anything Stop Butch Jones?</h2>
<p>Do you look good in orange? Do you have at least a year’s worth of NCAA eligibility remaining and a passing knowledge of the spread offense? What is your opinion on the Gap Band? <a href="http://tennessee.247sports.com/Board/114/Butch-Jones-said-his-favorite-music-18294898/1" target="_blank">Is it positive?</a> OK, cool, Butch Jones wants you to become a Tennessee Volunteer.</p>
<p>Jones has already amassed 34 commits, and he’s gunning for more. True, the Vols will probably lose a couple prospects to last-second changes of heart (looking at you, Cory Thomas), and yes, Jones is clearly exploiting <a href="http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/college-recruiting/2013/dec/09/sec-issues-statement-about-over-signing-loopholes/" target="_blank">oversigning loopholes</a>. But it seems to be working out:</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>Tennessee has 2 more top 300 defensive recruit commitments this year ( 8 ) than they&#039;ve signed in last 6 seasons combined!&mdash; <br />robert smith (@ESPNRobertSmith) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/ESPNRobertSmith/status/430166995732934659' data-datetime='2014-02-03T02:32:58+00:00'>February 03, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>7. How Much of an Influence Will Malik McDowell’s Parents Have on Their Son’s Decision?</h2>
<p>McDowell is a humongous (6-6, 260) four-star defensive tackle from Southfield, Michigan. Unfortunately, he and his parents don’t see eye-to-eye on this whole college thing.</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>Can Malik McDowell convince parents to let him go to <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23MichSt" title="#MichSt">#MichSt</a> or will he end up at <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23FSU" title="#FSU">#FSU</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23OhioState" title="#OhioState">#OhioState</a>? One of the intriguing storylines.&mdash; <br />Mike Farrell (@rivalsmike) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/rivalsmike/status/430390508847112192' data-datetime='2014-02-03T17:21:08+00:00'>February 03, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The issue here seems to be that McDowell&#8217;s parents aren&#8217;t particularly fond of some of his non-football friends at Michigan State. “I think he should leave the state because he has some friends who aren’t athletes … I don’t want them to be a distraction,” <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/ncfrecruiting/on-the-trail/post?id=51991" target="_blank">his father, Greg, explained to ESPN.com</a>. Florida State, Ohio State, and Michigan are also in the running for McDowell&#8217;s services, and each one has a legitimate shot at landing him. The Seminoles are obviously the reigning champs, but the Buckeyes got to make a final impression on McDowell this past weekend. Nevertheless, this is a kid who very clearly wants to stay in-state, so Michigan might be in play as a potential “<a href="https://twitter.com/rivalsmike/status/430392728657350656" target="_blank">compromise</a>” between McDowell and his staunchly anti-MSU parents. He’ll make his plans known tomorrow morning, and for maximum entertainment value we should all be rooting for him to side with Sparty. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXaQk-TDJk" target="_blank">Rich Homie Quan approves this message.</a></p>
<h2>8. How Does Al Golden Keep Landing Elite Classes When His Teams Are So Relentlessly Average?</h2>
<p>I know what you’re thinking …</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-100194" alt="winslow-shapiro-tri" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/winslow-shapiro-tri.jpg?w=658"   /></p>
<p>… but the days of taking Miami recruits to booster-sponsored yacht parties and the VIP room at Club LIV are OVER. The Hurricanes are now all about academic/administrative integrity, which frankly makes Golden’s eighth-ranked class (a) booooooring, and (b) totally unexplainable, especially since Golden was on his hands and knees begging for the Penn State job less than a month ago. And Golden&#8217;s class could get even better, as four-star dual-threat quarterback Treon Harris is a <a href="https://twitter.com/BFeldmanCBS/status/428566159755968513" target="_blank">real threat</a> to rebuff Florida State for Miami even though nobody has a better track record of getting his quarterbacks paid than Jimbo Fisher.</p>
<h2>9. Which Team Has the Nation’s Worst Recruiting Class?</h2>
<p>Troy. No one wants to play football for Troy.</p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/troy.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-100195" alt="troy" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/troy.png?w=658"   /></a></p>
<p>This is somewhat flummoxing. Who wouldn’t want to play in the Fun Belt? The Fun Belt is by definition <i>fun</i>, and also where NFL legend Lawrence Tynes got his start. Anyhow, best of luck to the seven daring individuals who make up Troy’s universally panned class of 2014. We’re all behind you.</p>
<h2>10. Where Might Some of the Top Uncommitted Prospects Sign?</h2>
<p><i>(All times Eastern; all announcements on ESPNU.)</i></p>
<p>Five-start cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, the top-ranked uncommitted recruit, is scheduled to make Wednesday’s most anticipated announcement at 2:05 p.m., and you should probably clear your schedule for it. Just last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/AdoreeKnows/statuses/428342279992922112" target="_blank">he narrowed his search down to four teams</a>: Florida, LSU, USC, and UCLA. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40AdoreeKnows&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime" target="_blank">I’m sure the fans of those programs are tweeting totally rational things at him right now</a>. Anyway, nobody has a clue where he’s going. Florida has seemingly come out of nowhere <a href="https://twitter.com/JHopkins247/status/430088041437216768" target="_blank">to lead the race</a>, but Jackson’s from California, so USC and UCLA are the sentimental favorites. Of course, Les Miles has more charisma than Steve Sarkisian, Jim Mora Jr., and Will Muschamp combined, so don&#8217;t rule out LSU. And don’t bother asking any of Jackson’s friends for information about his decision: <a href="https://twitter.com/AdoreeKnows/status/427675402392182784" target="_blank">They’d tell you, but they’d have to kill you</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, five-star defensive end Lorenzo Carter <a href="https://twitter.com/LCarter_25/statuses/429458526185218048" target="_blank">seems to be favoring his hometown Georgia Bulldogs</a>, but that didn’t stop Muschamp from trudging through last week’s snowpocalypse to make an in-home visit. Fisher visited the Carter home a day later, and Mark Richt made his final sales pitch over the weekend. Awkwardly enough, some of these visits ended up overlapping at one of Carter’s basketball games, where assistant coaches <a href="http://recruiting.blog.ajc.com/2014/01/27/hand-to-hand-combat-over-lorenzo-carter/" target="_blank">were literally jockeying for position</a> to sit near Carter’s mom. Recruiting does NOT bring out the best in people.</p>
<p>Offensively, 6-foot-3 wideout Malachi Dupre is the most coveted uncommitted prospect. Dupre boasts Louisiana state track titles in the long jump, triple jump, and high jump, and will be making his announcement at 10:30 a.m. The five schools vying for his services are UCLA, LSU, Ole Miss, Florida State, and Alabama, and Saban has unleashed his new secret weapon in a last-ditch attempt to land him: offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin, who knows <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/1490/a-peek-into-recruiting-with-south-carolina-s-jeffery" target="_blank">a thing</a> or <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3886703" target="_blank">two</a> about the SEC recruiting trail. Kiffin looks really enthused about his move from Southern California to Tuscaloosa.</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>Nations No. 1 WR @<a href="https://twitter.com/MalachiDupre">MalachiDupre</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23Alabama" title="#Alabama">#Alabama</a> HC Nick Saban &amp; OC Lane Kiffin at AM in-home visit. <a href="http://t.co/Y4BUxpMnGl" rel="nofollow">http://t.co/Y4BUxpMnGl</a>&mdash; <br />Gerry Hamilton (@HamiltonESPN) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/HamiltonESPN/status/428932513176621056' data-datetime='2014-01-30T16:47:34+00:00'>January 30, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Athlete Juju Smith, owner of inarguably the coolest name in the class of 2014, may have tipped his hand on Friday by <a href="https://twitter.com/Poly_Football/status/429471362537627650" target="_blank">reportedly</a> uttering the words “GO DUCKS!” at a high school football banquet. Because recruiting experts can put two and two together, everyone’s latest projections have Smith pegged to Oregon, but you’ll have to wait for his noontime announcement to find out for sure.</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to check out the announcements of defensive end Solomon Thomas (Arkansas, Stanford, UCLA) at 8:10 a.m., linebacker and Auburn native Rashaan Evans (Auburn, Alabama) at 11 a.m., and top offensive guard Damien Mama (USC, BYU, Alabama) at 11:30 a.m., all of which are sure to be doozies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100140&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><i>A lot of news happens overnight, but here&#8217;s the one big thing you </i>really<i> should know:</i></p>
<p><strong>Chicago Blackhawks</strong> right wing Patrick Kane put on a <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=400485085" target="_blank">stellar performance</a> against the <strong>Los Angeles Kings</strong> despite hearing about the death of his grandfather shortly before game time. Kane finished with two goals and one assist to carry his team to a 5-3 victory at Staples Center.</p>
<p>In other news from Chicago, <strong>Bulls</strong> center Joakim Noah <a href="http://espn.go.com/chicago/nba/story/_/id/10401154/joakim-noah-chicago-bulls-apologizes-refs-ejection" target="_blank">dropped big f-bombs</a> at the referees after receiving his second technical foul last night against the Kings. He was immediately ejected from the game.</p>
<p>For more updates on college basketball, the NBA, and soccer, read <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/about-last-night-cyclones-almost-famous/" target="_blank">Spike Friedman&#8217;s &#8220;About Last Night.&#8221;</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p><i>Here are a couple of interesting things we found yesterday that we wanted to share:</i></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LattMeone" target="_blank">Matt Leone</a> at Polygon wrote an oral history of <em>Street Fighter II</em> that is long and well, well worth your time. And anyone who argues that mashing buttons during a Chun-Li—Guile fight does not count as sports needs to rediscover childhood.</p>
<p>Also, on Twitter yesterday, the <strong>Wizards</strong> and <strong>Trail Blazers</strong> had some fun tongue-in-cheek banter after Washington beat Portland, 100-90:</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>Is it too late to join the Eastern Conference? Asking for a friend.&mdash; <br />Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/trailblazers/status/408327384241156096' data-datetime='2013-12-04T20:10:09+00:00'>December 04, 2013</a></p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p><i>Lastly, here are the sporting events that should be on your radar tonight (all times Eastern):</i></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s <strong>NBA</strong> games all qualify for &#8220;A Fate Worse Than Death,&#8221; but if you must, check out Suns-Bulls at 9 p.m. Phoenix is seeking its longest win streak in almost four years and is making its way up the Western Conference standings (they currently sit at sixth). The Suns should take this one, especially if Goran Dragic can continue performing despite a sore left elbow. Other games on the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/scoreboard?date=20140204" target="new">schedule</a>: Pacers-Hawks, Lakers-Timberwolves, Bobcats-Warriors.</p>
<p>In <strong>college hoops</strong>, quite a few top-25 teams are playing, though no matchup particularly stands out. No. 3 Florida, no. 15 Texas, and no. 8 Kansas all overshadow their opponents (Missouri, TCU, and Baylor, respectively), but each of those games should be entertaining. If you&#8217;re looking for a closer game with lots of personality, you&#8217;ll want to catch Ole Miss at no. 18 Kentucky at 7 p.m. The Wildcats boast a 21-game home winning streak and the fresh faces of Aaron Harrison, James Young, and Julius Randle. But with Marshall Henderson in the game, things could swing either way. Henderson currently leads the SEC in 3-pointers and 3-point attempts (77 for 212). You can find Big Ten, ACC, and AAC action <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/scoreboard?date=20140204&amp;breakdown=top25" target="new">here</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of <strong>NHL</strong> games for you to watch tonight, though none we would wholeheartedly recommend. There&#8217;s the Avalanche-Rangers at 7 p.m., which is probably the most promising of the early bunch. Then at 8 p.m., you can catch the Lightning&#8217;s slightly depleted offense play the down-in-the-dumps Wild, who are coming off two close losses. <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/scoreboard?date=20140204" target="new">Here</a> is the full listing of games for tonight.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100227&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lgbt-in-sochi-sl-tri.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-100176" alt="LGBT-in-Sochi-SL-TRI" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lgbt-in-sochi-sl-tri.jpg?w=658"   /></a></p>
<p><i>During the Sochi Olympic Games, Grantland will be posting updates from an anonymous blogger, a member of the LGBT community who is traveling to the Olympics this month. This project is created with the help of <a href="http://youcanplayproject.org/" target="_blank">You Can Play</a>, an organization that promotes diversity and LGBT inclusion in sports.</i><br />
<span id="more-100029"></span><br />
For the third morning in a row, I woke up before the sun. This day is a little different, though; on this day, I fly out to Sochi.</p>
<p>I’ve been staring at a blank screen for a few minutes now, not sure of how to make sense of what I’m experiencing and feeling. I’m restless and excited, but I’m also really scared. I rarely prepare myself for a trip where my sexual orientation and the expression of my views could put me in danger or land me in jail.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to my trip, I’ve been surrounded by talk of one thing and one thing only: security. How serious are <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/security-expert--its-not-if--but-how-bad-for-sochi-olympics-terror-attack-150717940.html" target="_blank">these terrorist threats</a>? Will the commute to, from, and around Olympic Park be safe? Why are so many athletes and high-profile attendees choosing to leave their families at home?</p>
<p>As if I already did not have enough reason to be concerned.</p>
<p>At least now I feel some sense of solidarity with others who, like me, are beginning to question whether any of this is worth the risk.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve doubted whether I should go through with this trip. Yes, I have a job to do in Sochi — I bear some level of responsibility to those I&#8217;m traveling with, <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/anonymous-in-sochi-back-in-the-closet-as-the-games-approach/" target="_blank">though I can&#8217;t share the details</a> — but lately, I have genuinely thought about just staying home.</p>
<p>During every good-bye, every person I speak to who knows I’m leaving for the Olympic Games gives me that same evasive look, veiled with a manufactured smile, aimed at concealing their apprehensions about my safety.</p>
<p>I smile back and pretend I haven’t noticed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>Two stories caught my attention in the lead-up to my flight out. First, Sochi’s mayor advised the world that there <a href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2014/story/_/id/10358250/2014-winter-olympics-mayor-anatoly-pakhomov-says-there-no-gay-people-sochi" target="_blank">are no gays in his city</a>. The second is that the U.K. government is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25955930" target="_blank">committing extra funds</a> to help gay-rights activists during the Games.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious how allies — athletes, journalists, and visitors (no matter their sexual orientation) — will communicate and organize once we’re all uncomfortably entrenched inside the Olympic environment. It’s no secret that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/28/5353466/russia-turns-sochi-into-a-surveillance-state-ahead-of-winter-olympics" target="_blank">emails, texts, and maybe even human interactions</a> will be monitored and scrutinized. So it&#8217;ll be quite remarkable to witness how people unite in spite of all the communication, logistical, and security barriers. This challenging new reality and its progression in and of itself are worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Everyone will be looking for that podium protest — that one act of defiance — and beyond that, the reaction from the local authorities. But to me, this doesn&#8217;t give enough credit to the real work being done.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this is a moment of great uncertainty, but also one of great potential. Through acts both large and small, these Games could help raise awareness, sure, but they could do even more than that. They could redefine the way entire regions of the world look at the LGBT community.</p>
<p>The sun has finally started to rise.</p>
<p>See you all in Sochi.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Every now and then, we will attempt to write the worst sports column on earth. Today: Let’s talk about Peyton Manning and a career full of disappointment.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>SECAUCUS, NEW JERSEY —</strong> Peyton Manning disappointed me.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the weather. Maybe it was something dark in his personal life, a crack in the shiny All-American façade that got exposed during Super Bowl week and took his head out of the game.</p>
<p>Or maybe when he came back from neck surgery two years ago, he used a performance-enhancing supplement. Maybe that enhanced his game more than anyone could have imagined, and maybe the NFL found out about it, and forced him to cycle off before the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Or maybe this is just Peyton Manning.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll probably never know what happened this weekend, but for now, go back and look at the losses. To the Steelers, to the Patriots, to the Saints in that Super Bowl, to the Ravens last year. Favored every time, loser over and over again.</p>
<p>Great players may lose now and then, but they don&#8217;t lose like that. Only Peyton Manning loses like that.</p>
<p>You half-expected Roger Goodell to get out there on the Super Bowl stage and apologize to America when he handed that trophy to the Seahawks. America deserved a better show.</p>
<p>But Peyton happened.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p><em>Everybody has an off night sometimes, his teammates made mistakes, his offensive line broke down, his numbers were still pretty good, the turnovers weren&#8217;t his fault </em>… Of course! The Peyton Manning Excuse Factory is still in business after all these years. After Sunday, business is booming.</p>
<p>But these are the facts. Three turnovers, one touchdown, and zero wins on Sunday. Peyton was so pedestrian out there, it&#8217;s a wonder he didn&#8217;t get flagged for jaywalking. He was so clueless you&#8217;d have thought he was running New Jersey Transit.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a question: How many times does he have to drive a team into a ditch before someone takes the keys away? Even O.J. wouldn&#8217;t want a ride with this white Bronco. Not after Sunday.</p>
<p>He can yell &#8220;Omaha!&#8221; till the cows come home, but it&#8217;s time to put a stake in him.</p>
<p>Peyton&#8217;s cooked, folks. You saw it Sunday.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad, too. I wanted him to turn the corner. I wrote about <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/hotsportstakes-the-manning-family-doesnt-want-it-badly-enough/" target="_blank">his family tradition earlier this year</a>, but I wanted him to leave it all behind, conquer his demons in front of the whole world. It didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>And look, one thing I always say is, if you haven&#8217;t been disappointed by an athlete you cover, you haven&#8217;t been in this business very long.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p>But as Sunday night turned into Monday morning and I stared out onto the MetLife field thinking about what it all meant, I remembered everyone else he let down.</p>
<p>His teammates who thought they were playing with the most valuable player in football. The millions of fans who gathered around the TV to watch their hero. The National Football League that spent two weeks promoting this blockbuster and got a big ol&#8217; flop from its leading man.</p>
<p>And big John Elway.</p>
<p>Big John spent the past few years building this roster from scratch, turning it from a joke to a juggernaut. He&#8217;s got nothing left to prove with me or anyone else, but he felt loyal to the Broncos organization, owner Pat Bowlen, and the city of Denver, so he did it.</p>
<p>Almost overnight, Denver had a playoff team on its hands, and after that, the Broncos became one of the best teams in football.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the Elway effect. That&#8217;s what adding a winner will do for your franchise.</p>
<p>You want to talk great Super Bowls? For the rest of my life, I&#8217;ll never forget him in 1998, rolling out of the pocket on that third down, diving headfirst into three Packers, getting hit and spinning through the air for a first down.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s football, folks. That was a quarterback putting his body on the line because he just wanted it that bad. Elway was 37 that day, just like Peyton is now, and he won his championship, because the National Football League rewards that kind of sacrifice.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see that sacrifice from Peyton on Sunday.</p>
<p>I saw a whole lotta ducks and a goose egg on the scoreboard. (He was playing &#8220;duck, duck, goose egg&#8221; out there, but this wasn&#8217;t preschool. It was the Super Bowl.)</p>
<p>It all made me sad for Big John. When you think about Peyton&#8217;s father and where he came from and what he&#8217;s become, he has all the quarterback DNA you could ever want.</p>
<p>Except the only gene that matters.</p>
<p>The gene that John had.</p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/52025343.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-100073" alt="ELWAY-JOHN" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/52025343.jpg?w=658&#038;h=516"   /></a></p>
<p>So while the Seahawks celebrate and go sleepless in Seattle, the Broncos are looking up what to do in Denver when you&#8217;re dead.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s life with Peyton.</p>
<p>You think back to how this season started, with seven touchdowns on opening night, and you can&#8217;t help but shake your head. Maybe some guys spend their whole lives getting ready for the biggest game of the season, and other guys are built for Week 1.</p>
<p>My question is, how much longer does Denver let Peyton start the year if we know he&#8217;s going to finish like this?</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t play the Super Bowl in September.</p>
<p>For a Denver team lined with talent, maybe it&#8217;s time to end a relationship that was always sort of a fling in the first place. Manning might be the most famous player in the NFL, but commercials don&#8217;t win championships. Hype doesn&#8217;t convert a third down in the Super Bowl, heart does.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/WpJaJM4Cy8o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>I care about the Denver Broncos, and their fans deserve better than the guy who&#8217;ll get them just far enough to let everyone down.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to Elway to make the call now.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be easy, but winning Lombardi Trophies isn&#8217;t supposed to be. The longer the Broncos stick with Peyton, the further they are from finding a guy who understands that. From finding another Big John.</p>
<p>Denver rode Peyton hard, and it got ’em nowhere.</p>
<p>The no. 1 Bronco bucked under the pressure. Kicked up his heels and said &#8220;nayyyyy&#8221; when it was time to play. So what do you do when a horse pulls up lame?</p>
<p>The excuse factory may never close with Peyton Manning.</p>
<p>But the glue factory&#8217;s open, too.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100054&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Yasiel Puig may not strike one as a prototypical leadoff hitter, but he could find himself in the top spot for Don Mattingly this coming season. Mattingly said by switching Puig and last year&#8217;s leadoff hitter, lefty-swinging Carl Crawford, in the order, it would provide better righty-lefty balance, with right-handed hitter Hanley Ramirez batting third and left-handed hitter Adrian Gonzalez batting fourth.</title>
