				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n Christmas Eve 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, soon occupying the capital and toppling the nation&#8217;s leader. A few months later, a deeply divided United States Olympic Committee voted to boycott the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow. How the one event led irrevocably to the other remains one of the more confounding intersections of sports and politics in American history.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Cold War, the outrage over the Soviet invasion seemed to demand some response, and the idea of a Western boycott of the Games (the first to be held in a communist nation) soon gained momentum. Among the most vociferous supporters of a boycott was the Pulitzer Prize–winning columnist Red Smith, who wrote so passionately about it that his editors at the<i> New York Times</i> killed one of his pieces, a first in his then 35-year writing career.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-1"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a></p>
<p>On January 20, 1980, President Carter announced that he would recommend American athletes boycott the Games in Moscow, unless the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Afghanistan.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-2"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a> When the deadline passed and Carter made his support official, the juxtaposition was stark — the Soviets had come to compete in the Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York, even as the Americans were threatening to boycott the Summer Games in the USSR.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-3"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></a> Against that backdrop, the U.S. men&#8217;s hockey team&#8217;s &#8220;Miracle on Ice&#8221; upset of the Soviets on the way to a gold medal carried extra significance. While Carter had the considerable bully pulpit of the presidency, he left the decision up to the United States Olympic Committee. When the USOC chose to follow Carter&#8217;s recommendation, the biggest sports event of the summer suddenly didn&#8217;t have any Americans competing in it.</p>
<p>NBC, which had scheduled two weeks of prime-time and late-night coverage, scrapped its plans. Hundreds of U.S. media outlets decided not to send reporters. And almost all of the reportedly 20,000 Americans who&#8217;d made plans to attend the Games canceled their trip. One yardstick to measure the boycott&#8217;s effect on Americans&#8217; interest was the traveling party sponsored by <i>Track &amp; Field News</i>, which had been coordinating groups attending the Olympics since 1952. Before Americans pulled out of the Games, the publication had booked a contingent of nearly 2,000 people for the Moscow journey. After the news? The group was reduced to 137.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-4"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s where George Plimpton<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-5"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a> comes in. Already celebrated for his own trips onto the fields of play as a participatory journalist, Plimpton joined the <i>Track &amp; Field News</i> touring delegation on assignment from <i>Time</i>.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-6"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></a> As <i>Time</i> put it in the introduction to the first of Plimpton&#8217;s two weekly dispatches, &#8220;His role this time was not to play but to watch, to go to the Moscow Olympics as that rara avis, given the U.S. boycott, an American tourist at the Games.&#8221; Those short pieces<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-7"><sup id="ss-7">7</sup></a> gave some of the flavor of the Games. But it was Plimpton&#8217;s longer, more discursive (and in many ways, more Plimptonian) account of the unseen Olympics, which ran that fall in <i>Harper&#8217;s</i>, that provided the most vivid, lasting account of the curious event that was the XXII Olympiad.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<h2>Moscow Games</h2>
<p><b><i>Harper&#8217;s</i></b><br />
<b>October 1980</b><br />
<b>By George Plimpton</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Tip-toe incognito,&#8221; whispered Mister Bumpus.<i><br />
—The Travels of Dr. Doolittle</i></p>
<p>THOSE WHO HAVE been here before are surprised at the emptiness, really an eerie one, of the city. Some are reminded of Paris during the August <i>fermature annuelle</i>,<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-8"><sup id="ss-8">8</sup></a> and indeed for the four summer months there is an annual exodus from Moscow of a large percentage of the population … to dachas, to the resorts along the Black Sea, and the youngsters (their absence is the most noticeable) to the Pioneer<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-9"><sup id="ss-9">9</sup></a> camps. But this year more people are gone. To make room for the visitors to the Olympic Games and to keep the best face on the city many people have been asked not to come into Moscow at this time unless they have official business, and some, such as alcoholics and various undesirables, have simply been removed — swept not just under the carpet, but into dustbins, carried out and deposited elsewhere. On the bus today, a group of Californians were wondering how this deportation process might be carried out in Los Angeles in 1984, when the Olympic Games are scheduled to be held there. The junkies, it was suggested, should be relegated to Needles, California, the alcoholics to tent cities in the Napa Valley, the drifters to Palmdale, and the elderly ladies in tennis shoes to Tijuana. &#8220;In each case,&#8221; a Californian pointed out, &#8220;Los Angeles would benefit from their absence, and where they went would benefit from their presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giving a city a face-lift is called &#8220;Potemkin-izing,&#8221;<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-10"><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a> after Prince Grigori Potemkin, Catherine the Great&#8217;s shrewd adviser, not to mention her lover and, after he had fallen out of her amorous favor, the custodian of her male harem. To impress the empress on a trip through the newly conquered Crimea, Potemkin constructed a fake portable village, complete with a population of healthy-looking shepherds and shepherdesses, which he would set up along her travel route, and when she was resting for the night, he would pack up the village and hurry it along past her to be set up anew where she would pass it the next day — trusting, I suppose, that she would fail to notice that the shepherds and shepherdesses looked startlingly like the ones she had seen the day before.</p>
<p>Potemkin-izing is not specifically a Russian trait: one thinks of the false fronts along the streets of the western cowpoke towns built to make the buildings look as if they had two or three stories. Christo,<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-11"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a> the Bulgarian-born artist who wraps buildings in canvas, once told me that his first job in his native country was to help with the painting of vast backdrops of fake vistas along the rail lines — a task that doubtless inspired some of the scenic fiddling of his latter massive projects in the West, such as wrapping part of the coast of Australia.</p>
<p>As this is my first visit to Moscow, I find it difficult to gauge how much Potemkin-izing has gone on. It would be safe to say, in any case, that those who are critical of the society would consider the cleaning-up process to be Potemkin-izing; others, more tolerant, might say, &#8220;Well, the old girl&#8221; — referring to Moscow — &#8220;certainly got herself a splendid facelift last month.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had been told by people before leaving for Moscow to watch myself — that because I had written in opposition to the U.S. boycott of the Olympic Games in a national magazine the Russian press would be around to see me, television cameras and all, and that whatever I said would be twisted to their purposes. Furthermore, because I have supported Amnesty International and have close friends who work actively for it, I would surely be followed, my luggage searched, and my hotel room bugged. This last, I was told by insiders, would be something of an advantage in that if I wanted my laundry back I should face all four walls of my room and to each in turn shout my discontent and &#8220;No starch, please.&#8221; The best way to nudge the laundry room is to get the KGB involved.</p>
<p>A sense of this affects everyone who comes to the Soviet Union — a pervading feeling that one is playing a real-life role in a spy drama. So paranoid does the average tourist become, and so substantial is the American ego, that it comes not only as a surprise, but something of a disappointment, when nothing happens. One of my friends with the track-and-field group, with which I am traveling, told me that he felt a tap on the shoulder yesterday getting off a bus. He turned to see a policeman and his heart sank abruptly into his shoes. &#8220;This is it,&#8221; he thought. The policeman bowed slightly and handed my friend a piece of paper that had dropped from his pocket. My friend was enormously relieved, of course, but afterward he told me there had been just the slightest twinge of disappointment that the official had not said, in excellent English, &#8220;Mr. Lane, will you come with us, please.&#8221;<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-12"><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a></p>
<p>It was in reaction to being ignored by the Soviet authorities that many stories, most of them second, even thirdhand, circulated in the hotel lobbies and at mealtimes, apparently to salve the feeling, <i>What is wrong with me? Why hasn&#8217;t there been a sharp knock on the door at midnight?</i></p>
<p>The most common of these stories was that so-and-so had surprised a KGB agent in his or her hotel room rummaging through the luggage. Whistles of alarm from those listening, and nods of I told you so. But that was always as far as the story went — we never found out what happened then. What did the Soviet agent do? Did he leap for the window? It must have been awfully embarrassing for him. Why hadn&#8217;t he jumped for the armoire when he heard the key in the door? Or pretended to be repairing the rug? But no, the description was always of him with his hands in the suitcase, startled, looking up like a raccoon caught in the car light&#8217;s beam and the overturned garbage cans.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-13"><sup id="ss-13">13</sup></a></p>
<p>Paranoia even crept into the performance of my official function in Moscow, which was to cover the games for <i>Time</i> magazine in the guise of a tourist. I was told to stay away from the Time-Life offices. &#8220;There&#8217;s a KGB man in the courtyard,&#8221; I was told over the phone. &#8220;Your cover may be blown if you turn up here. So you&#8217;re to meet your contact, a girl named B. J. Phillips, in Pushkin Park and pass your copy to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I recognize B. J. Phillips?&#8221; I asked. I felt like putting a handkerchief over the mouthpiece of the phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be difficult,&#8221; I was told. &#8220;She&#8217;s got a broken leg. She&#8217;ll be wearing a cast and a supporting herself on two canes — one steel, one wood. She wears big aviator glasses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>A while later, I called up to say that I wasn&#8217;t sure anyone could read my handwriting (I had been advised to leave my portable typewriter at home) and perhaps it would be best if I came in to the office to type up my copy before going out to Pushkin Park. I didn&#8217;t say this directly. I used a few hastily made-up code words to confuse anyone who happened to be listening in. Rather than <i>copy</i> I used the word <i>poppy</i>. &#8220;After it&#8217;s cultivated,&#8221; I whispered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring the poppy to Eugene Origin&#8217;s garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>The editor finally gave up the subterfuge and let me come in to type. It turned out that B. J. Phillips was in the next office, her leg propped up on a chair, working on her stories. I asked if it was all right to come around the corner and give her my copy rather than going out to Pushkin Park. The editor said it was fine with him as long as we turned out the lights so no one could see us through the window.</p>
<p>Sometimes, with the U.S. team not there, it was difficult to know for whom to root at the games. One tended to support those from the Western countries when they competed<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-14"><sup id="ss-14">14</sup></a> — Allan Wells, Daley Thompson, Sebastian Coe,<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-15"><sup id="ss-15">15</sup></a> and Steve Ovett of England<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-16"><sup id="ss-16">16</sup></a> (it was especially difficult when, in the case of the last two, both were in the same race), Peitro Mennea, the Italian sprinter, José Marajo of France, any Finn (they were the merriest people around town), and, from the socialist bloc, the Polish polevaulter, Wladyslaw Kozakiewicz, if for no other reason than it was seemly if a Pole won the pole vault. He did, too, hoisting himself up just a half-inch under nineteen feet for a world record.</p>
<p>I kept a small list of people at the other end of the competitive scale — those who seemed almost sublime in their ineptitudes. Byong Uk Il, for example, a Korean boxer, who got so frustrated with himself that he began kicking at this opponent. Or the two fighters, Ismael Moustalov and Ahmed Siad, from Bulgaria and Algeria respectively, who fought such a dull fight that a friend of mine turned to his companion to say, &#8220;You can go to sleep watching this,&#8221; and discovered that he <i>was</i>.</p>
<p>In the women&#8217;s gymnastics, both the entire Mongolian and North Korean teams made my list. The measure of their ability was somehow symbolized by the musical accompaniment to their floor exercises. Everyone else had picked large orchestral pieces, the flow of a hundred violins or the disco beat seeming to pick up the gymnast and whirl her across the vast expanse of matting. But when the Mongolian girl, dressed in robin&#8217;s egg blue, stood poised for her first cartwheeling run, we heard first the loud amplified <i>click</i> of a tape recorder being turned on, and then what sounded like perhaps a pair of ancient player pianos being played at the same time, but with different tunes, so that a cascade of arpeggios roared down in a confused jumble through which the gymnast hopped and cartwheeled and was tumbled over as if in a great draft of wind. Kang Myong Duk was my favorite. On the beam she moved from one end to the other like a boy crossing a log over a swift-moving trout stream. Susan Cheesebourough of England was another favorite. Orange suited, she began to fall off the beam during her routine, but, almost regaining her balance, she poised, one leg flung out grotesquely, for a long, appalling instant, long enough for someone to call out, &#8220;Hang on, old girl!&#8221; before she finally slipped off.</p>
<p>At track and field, heading my losers&#8217; list was a contestant in the twenty kilometer walk — a gentleman from Laos with certainly the loveliest name of the 1980 Olympics, Thipsamy Chantaphone. The race had long been thought to be over. Suddenly, an hour and a half behind the twenty-fourth walker, who was assumed to have brought up the rear, Mr. Chantaphone appeared — whisking through the great doors at the east end of the Lenin Stadium onto the track for his last lap. When the huge crowd realized that the man hurrying along in that crazy strut of the distance walker was a contestant in a race long thought to be finished, they rose to their feet and began cheering Mr. Chantaphone. Pandemonium! Mr. Chantaphone was not in the least abashed. He began waving his arms; an enormous smile ignited his features. He stopped and bowed — thus increasing his time to an even more horrendous total. One had the sense of his carrying an imaginary sign above his head: I am Thipsamy Chantaphone, Walker of Walkers.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-17"><sup id="ss-17">17</sup></a></p>
<p>It was interesting how some of the poorer athletes measured up to the stress of the Olympics. Some gave up from the start. In the third heat of the 1500 meters, a Vietnamese named Quang Khai Le started out last, stayed comfortably there, and finished last by twenty-six seconds. On the other hand, Marzoug Mabruk, a Liberian, burst out to lead the pack in his heat, turning it on absolutely full blast for two and one-fourth laps, and then, of course, ran out of steam and was passed by everybody. But at least he had the satisfaction of telling the folks back in Monrovia that he had &#8220;set the pace&#8221; and shown his heels to the rest of them for awhile. Maybe he would go so far as to say his coach had run him at the wrong distance.</p>
<p>Pizzazz, that was the thing! A fighter name Wamba from a West African country came rushing out yesterday at the five-second warning bell and began fighting, so stirring up his opponent that he got himself knocked out almost immediately.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-18"><sup id="ss-18">18</sup></a> He made my list … right up there with Thipsamy Chantaphone.</p>
<p>But my two favorite losers remain those English yachtsmen at the Montreal games who were so disgusted at the turtlelike qualities of their Tempest-class yacht <i>Gift ’Orse</i> that they set fire to her and watched from a dinghy until she eventually sank. Of the two men, the crew member, merrily tanked up on booze, was especially critical, not only of the <i>Gift ’Orse</i> but also of his skipper; he accused him of lacking in style. &#8220;I told him his place as captain was with the ship but he refused to go down with her.&#8221;<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-19"><sup id="ss-19">19</sup></a></p>
<p>A lot of stories about fires drifted around the hotel lobbies today. A man wearing a straw hat was reported to have self-immolated this morning in Red Square. It was such a fragmentary story that it would doubtless have been discounted if it had not been for that detail about the straw hat. A boater? Rather a jaunty one?</p>
<p>We also heard that in the spirit of the boycott the British had burned all their allotted tickets to the games. The boycott was actually thought up by the British — at least they were the ones who proposed the idea at a hastily convened meeting in Moscow at the news that the Russian troops had crossed the border into Afghanistan. I was surprised to hear at the American embassy that the purpose of the boycott had little to do with informing the Russian populace about the Afghanistan situation. The Russians are amply supplied with news from the West, if they wish to be, through the BBC and the Voice of America broadcasts, which have not been jammed since 1973, and of course word of mouth spreads very quickly news that might not appear in <i>Pravda</i>. Rather, the intent of the boycott was to indicate to Brezhnev and Co. how seriously the Western powers took the Soviet encroachment … a gesture to the top brass. This news increased my skepticism about the value of the boycott. Surely a high official would be more upset by the moves in the diplomatic and trade channels — such as the defection of the Romanians and North Koreans in the General Assembly voting over the Afghan issue, and the obvious disgust of the Third World at the Russian incursion. Besides, did leaders such as Brezhnev wring their hands over such steps as an athletic boycott? He is in the Crimea somewhere. He&#8217;s apparently a great soccer fan,<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-20"><sup id="ss-20">20</sup></a> but he has not been on hand for the games, save for the opening ceremonies where he stood and applauded at moments that pleased him, clapping his hands together slowly, as if his internal machinery had run down.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole Soviet political presence seems absent from the games. In a city awash with flags, the only Soviet banners I have seen fly from atop the Great Kremlin Palace and off the sterns of the <i>vaporetti</i> that ply the Moscow River.</p>
<p>The official box at Lenin Stadium, roofed, and with a long row of red-covered seats, has been empty since the opening ceremonies. That&#8217;s one thing the Soviet Hierarchy does not do — give its tickets away to secretaries and friends.</p>
<p>In the Hotel Ukraine,<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-21"><sup id="ss-21">21</sup></a> where I am staying, there has been a lot of lobby talk among the track-and-field people about cheating out at the games — Soviet judges giving their countrymen the edge even in such events that require measurements, such as the hammer, the shot put, and the discus. I would think it highly improbable, even lunatic, for a troika of judges and assistants (three of these officials converge where the thrown object first dents the grass, scampering to the spot like boys rushing for a tossed coin) to jockey the measuring sticks around, especially under the gaze of 103,000 spectators, many of whom are equipped with high-powered binoculars. But the rumors persist. The most curious is that the great runway doors at the west end of the stadium have been swung open to allow the wind funneling through to aid the javelin tosses of the Russians, and that when a Pole or an East German steps up for his toss, the tall, hangarlike portals are swung shut to cut the windstream off. Nonsense, of course, unless the wind were literally roaring through, blowing the hair straight forward off the brows of the javelin throwers looking downfield. <i>That</i> sort of a wind might carry a javelin with it, but we haven&#8217;t had anything like that at all: the high clouds hang almost motionless in the pink evening sky. Besides, javelin throwers are unnerved by a following wind, which tends to shove the tail of the javelin down so that it hits the ground first, thus disqualifying the toss.</p>
<p>Flimflamming has also been reported in the triple-jump (once called less decorously, if more accurately, &#8220;the hop-skip-and-jump&#8221;). Here, an Australian named Ian Campbell and a Brazilian named Joao de Oliveira were called for fouls on nine of their twelve jumps, which made it easier for the Russians to place first and second.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-22"><sup id="ss-22">22</sup></a></p>
<p>I had particularly noticed the Brazilian, Oliveira. After his last try, in what seemed to me a most sportsmanlike gesture, he leapt out of the landing pit and began shaking hands with everyone in sight — the pit sweepers, the man who sits in a small chair and leans forward to prepare the takeoff board after the previous jumper had marked it, the judges up the line — and from the stands the applause began to flow down in appreciation. The man next to me said, &#8220;Well, so much for how much these folk know about track. Don&#8217;t they realize the Brazilian is being <i>ironic?</i> He&#8217;s knocking them. He&#8217;s showing everyone how awful he thinks the judging has been.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had been applauding along with everyone else. I stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I mean, why doesn&#8217;t he punch them in the snoot if he feels that way about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; the man replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s all a question of symbolic gesture. You&#8217;ve got to know how to read these things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don Rollen,<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-23"><sup id="ss-23">23</sup></a> the ubiquitous fan who wears a vertically-striped painted beehive hairdo and invariably sits in the stands where the TV cameras can pick him out — &#8220;Rock ’n’ Rollin&#8221; he calls himself — was picked up next to the press center by the Soviet police for &#8220;looking odd&#8221; (as an official at the American embassy described the incident to me) and then released. &#8220;He <i>does</i> look odd,&#8221; someone said to me, hearing the news. &#8220;With that hairdo of his he looks like St. Basil&#8217;s Cathedral on the move.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hotel Ukraine is one of the seven skyscrapers built around Moscow in the 1950s. The style is Russian art deco, not unlike — unless my memory flags — the compromise architectural monstrosity that gets blown up in the climactic finale of Ayn Rand&#8217;s <i>The Fountainhead</i>. The place is, nonetheless, an oasis to our group — a home base to which everyone repairs after the games for meals, however unpalatable the latter turn out to be. One of my tablemates, looking down at a small section of fish waiting for him on his plate, and debating whether to tuck his napkin under his chin before knuckling down to it, remarked on what a shame it was that the French had only spent three months in Moscow in 1812. &#8220;A few months more, and a bit of the French cuisine might have rubbed off,&#8221; he said mournfully.</p>
<p>One of the more novel aspects of dining at the Ukraine was that the majordomo of the dining room, a stout figure in a light grey suit, felt it was uncompanionable (and possibly a bad, bourgeois habit) to wish to eat by oneself. If I came into the dining room alone, he would imperiously motion me to an empty seat at a table already occupied — very much as if he were a social director on a cruise ship trying to get his single passengers to mix. But it was difficult if my tablemates turned out to come from Nepal with no common language to share. One lunch he sat me next to a poultry farmer from east Texas who over coffee told me that in his business chicks are pumped up to the size of broilers in only six weeks. &#8220;We don&#8217;t let them chicks sleep,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;We jes&#8217; keep the lights on and let ’em <i>eat</i>.&#8221; The thought of those gorging birds stayed with me, disturbingly, through an afternoon of watching weight lifting, when the entrance of every weight lifter through the small stage door off to one side of the stage was accompanied by a mental image of a vast, slow-stepping, big-thighed emu.</p>
<p>Hailing a taxi, the usual procedure if it stops and you&#8217;re alone is to get in and ride, not in the back seat, but up front with the driver — a pleasant enough practice that evokes the egalitarian spirit. The trouble is that such proximity suggests one should strike up a conversation with the driver. It&#8217;s rude — or at least it feels rude — to sit next to someone and stare stolidly out the window. It&#8217;s like hunching up a chair to a restaurant table where someone is seated alone and then not saying anything. So I try. It has struck me that I know many more Russian proper names than I do words, and how difficult and limiting it is to carry on a dialogue by mentioning in turn Tolstoi, Chekov, Tchaikovsky, Maiokovski, Pushkin (&#8220;Ah, Pushkin!&#8221;), Beria (thrust of the thumb down), Khrushchev (sideways motion of the hand to denote ambivalence), Stalin (thumbs down), Olga Korbut (thumbs up), and so forth. It&#8217;s exhausting, and I only did it once; after that, I sat in the back. The driver did not seem to mind. At least I could detect no sign of hurt feelings.</p>
<p>Nadia Comaneci is a woman now — long, ropy legs like a racehorse&#8217;s, a bosom! — and she towers over the strange, Munchkinlike gamines who dominate that peculiar sport like a light standard. In the troughlike walkways around the performing areas, the tiny gymnasts keep loose with slow, lovely cartwheels (they are upside down much of the time) and with a myriad of relaxing exercises, one of which is a trembling of the leg muscles as if trying to shake a bug off a toe. Nadia stands apart.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-24"><sup id="ss-24">24</sup></a> She seems like a teenager at a lower-school recess. She doesn&#8217;t submit herself as much to the exercises; with her, the preparation seems more mental. What could be running through her mind? Her primary rival (who eventually dethroned her as overall champion)<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-25"><sup id="ss-25">25</sup></a> is Yelena Davidova, a Russian, who is exactly Nadia&#8217;s age (eighteen), but who by some genetic chance has not been assaulted by womanhood: she is still as flat-chested as a boy; the sheen on her legs is smooth; she is elfin — seventy-five pounds. Her floor routine is sexy, with little, exquisite bottom-shake movements that a purist friend of mine haughtily referred to as &#8220;kiddieporn.&#8221; True, if Nadia tried such things, it would seem undignified. But I found Davidova&#8217;s routine whimsical and charming. &#8220;Oh, Christ,&#8221; a purist friend said in disgust.</p>
<p>In Gorky Park I stopped at a bowling alley housed in a barrage-balloonlike bubble at the edge of the wide river balustrade. The place, without air conditioning, was an inferno of heat. A dozen pinball machines along the wall were in operation. I doubt the Russians make such things, but at least they have adapted foreign models for home-country use, to judge from the flashing Cyrillic lettering. Some penny-arcade war machines were also busy — the familiar American sound of the thump and whine of miniature electronic holocausts. I looked over the shoulder of a player and saw a torpedo wake heading for a red tramp steamer ploughing along doughtily against a painted horizon.</p>
<p>Russian bowling, though, has a peculiarly unique style. Apparently the bowler plays by the hour rather than by the number of games bowled, so that the criterion of performance rests on the number of throws rather than any emphasis on scoring. Bowling balls were got rid of down the dilapidated, pocked alleys as if they were fused in some way, and about to go off; they were flung with abandon, often into the gutter, and on occasion they smacked into the guardrail of the Brunswick pin-setting apparatus while the tenpins were still being settled into place — the shattering crash of such impacts rising above the general din: the guardrail would lift as if in alarmed haste above the pins, which would teeter there for just an instant before a bowling ball, often with another immediately on its tail, would smack into them. I only saw one scorecard being kept along the row of alleys — a man scribbling full-bent to keep up with the frantic activities of the players in front of him.</p>
<p><em>Speed</em> was also a requirement of the ball&#8217;s delivery. I have never seen bowling balls <em>hurled</em> … like cannonballs they bounced a third of the way up the alley. The preferred method of throwing them was with a two-fingered grip, as if either someone had figured out that the care required to insert the third finger was too time-consuming, or perhaps that the three-fingered grip was too dangerous: one might not be able to extricate one&#8217;s hand at the end of the follow-through and thus be carried along up the alley behind the ball like a human streamer.</p>
<p>I left the alley after fifteen minutes or so. Outside, even with the weekend crowds thick and festive, and the calliope sounds from the merry-go-rounds and ferris wheels, and the calls of the children from the boat ponds, my ears were soothed by the comparative quiet.</p>
<p>T-shirts everywhere — international slogans, ad copy, funnies, poems, epithets, epigrams, pronouncements, assertions, admissions, paintings — carried around on tens of thousands of walking billboards. A lot of Mickey Mouse sweat shirts. The most arresting message I saw was an American T-shirt on the back of a pleasant-enough looking chap — I wondered vaguely if he could speak English and knew that what he was brandishing read as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">JOIN THE ARMY<br />
TRAVEL TO EXOTIC LANDS<br />
MEET UNUSUAL PEOPLE<br />
AND KILL THEM<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-26"><sup id="ss-26">26</sup></a></p>
<p>The blue jean is the truly coveted item from the Western world. But the Russian youth are very particular about their blue jeans. They turn up their noses at the Hong Kong-made models, which are the fancy brands preferred in the United States — the Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, Sassoon brand names with the tight behinds and the stitched back pockets — and instead the Russian teenagers opt for American-made Levis, Texas Wranglers, and Sharpshooter models. The jeans are worn beltless; they don&#8217;t even rip off the size identification labels. There is a brisk black market in blue jeans. In our group are three young brothers from Michigan who were approached just off Red Square by their Russian counterparts, young men who were interested in buying the trio&#8217;s blue jeans right off their bodies. Only one of the Americans was wearing underwear, apparently, so he went around a corner and, divesting himself of his blue jeans, got back to the hotel wearing a pair of blue boxer shorts, eighty rubles (over a hundred dollars) richer. He had taken a brave enough entrepreneurial risk, though not as brave as his brothers&#8217; would have been had they given up their jeans.</p>
<p>The light switches in my hotel room, and in every room I have been in so far in Moscow, are placed six feet up on the wall. How do small children, much less midgets and gnomelike men, turn on the lights in the evening? Do they wrestle chairs around and stand on them? Paintings are invariably hung up near the ceiling. Such interiors, it occurred to me, are very suitable for Peter the Great, who was almost seven feet tall; when he strode around St. Petersburg his courtiers had to run alongside full tilt to hear what he had to say to them. Yesterday I saw an odd wooden statue of Peter in Leningrad&#8217;s Hermitage that was fashioned just after his death and is supposedly an exact replica — a <i>body</i> mask rather than one of the face. He is seated in a chair wearing blue-gray court clothes, the tunic very dusty; it looks as if, were it smacked smartly, dust would emerge in a large cloud. His hands and feet are tiny, absurdly out of proportion to the body. His head is as round as a soccer ball, with a small black moustache tacked on at a curious angle. His hair, which is coal black, is reported to be his own. The countenance is quite foolish. The replica works; that is to say it can be pushed around like a wooden artist&#8217;s model in a figure-drawing class. I wish the curators of the Hermitage had him standing upright rather than slouched in a chair looking like a man who feels he is on the verge of suffering a severe gas pain. It would be interesting to have a correspondence with the authorities in the museum on this matter: &#8220;Dear Sirs …&#8221; The fact is I wish I had not seen him at all. Once, his enormous empty boots were on display at an exhibition I saw in New York&#8217;s Metropolitan Museum, and the imaginary portrait generated in my mind from seeing them is certainly one I prefer to what I saw in the Hermitage.</p>
<p>The Moscow subway, as everyone knows, is the eighth wonder of the world. However much one has heard about the opulence of the stations with their marble, their statuary, and their chandeliers, and the speed and cleanliness of the trains, one is unprepared. I am especially impressed with the escalators, which with alarming speed seem to disappear at a sharp decline down to the point of infinity — such a long and deep descent that at lunch today a professor from Chicago pointed out that only an atheist culture could venture so close to the infernal regions.</p>
<p>I went to see Lenin in his mausoleum this morning — &#8220;his Nibs&#8221;<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-27"><sup id="ss-27">27</sup></a> as our contingent refers to him. Foreigners are able to get to the head of the long line and with special guides sweep in without delay, but I thought it would be more interesting to go to the end of the line, which, when I joined it, stretched down Red Square and around a corner into a leafy park under the western wall of the Kremlin. We shuffled slowly by the great terrace that contains the flame of the Unknown Soldier. Fresh flowers lie on the stone. We watched a raven move with big hops among the flowers and then shy away abruptly from the heat of the flame. What is it that attracts the raven to national monuments, especially those with murky pasts, such as the Tower of London and the Kremlin? Behind me in the line were two boxers from Nigeria. I fell back and got into conversation with them. Their boxing coach four years ago had been Archie Moore, the former light-heavyweight champion of the world and an old friend. We reminisced about him as we moved through the park. Moore&#8217;s team had never gone to the Olympics in Montreal. Most of the Third World countries boycotted the 1976 games because of their collective annoyance with New Zealand for having hosted a rugby team from South Africa — a sensitivity that certainly showed the degree of their feeling about isolating the latter country, but also seemed a somewhat farfetched and arbitrary reaction. The Nigerians volunteered as much. When I asked their opinion of the 1976 boycott, one of them threw his hands apart in a gesture of futility. &#8220;Poof!&#8221; he said. He made much the same kind of sound when I asked him about the U.S. boycott. &#8220;Too bad. Too bad,&#8221; his friend said.</p>
<p>We moved out of the shadows of the park and up into the sunlight and vastness of Red Square. Conversations in the column began to die away. We were directed into double lines — security men, some in plainclothes, every dozen paces or so, peered closely at us. A small, untidy man in front of me had a bulge in his coat pocket, which turned out to be a piece of dried fish wrapped carefully in an old newspaper. His lunch. He unwrapped it three times for the security people as we moved along. Now there was no sound but the shuffling of feet; one was subdued as much by the ministrations of the security people as by the grim facade of the tomb with its absurdly small door, room for two of us at a time to enter.</p>
<p>Once inside, the chill of the mausoleum increased markedly as our column turned sharply to the left and filed down a marble stairway — it was almost palpable, like stepping into a pool of deep shadow. Two turns to the right, and ahead I saw an odd white object that I suddenly realized was Lenin&#8217;s right ear, shining, remarkably delineated compared to most ears, I remember thinking fleetingly as we turned into the catafalque, and I saw the high forehead, the pale face, the faint reddish beard, the hands luminous above the black of either a coverlet or a black suit … the chiaroscuro effect of the lighting and the dispatch with which we were being hastened around the foot of the glass-enclosed bier made it difficult to tell. I had no sense of his feet sticking up at the foot of the bier — protuberances that always add a small touch of absurdity to the mien of a human lying on his back.</p>
<p>Then in front of me, just as we made the turn to pass down the left side of the catafalque, a man suddenly started sobbing. Almost instantaneously, a soldier moved out of the shadows. He leaned forward, within inches of the man&#8217;s face, and with a finger to his lips he hissed, &#8220;Sssh!&#8221;… explosively loud in that enclosed gloom — the sharp sound of a nanny admonishing a child — and the man&#8217;s sob stopped in mid-flight, like a hiccup.</p>
<p>The sunlight was refreshing once we got outside. Our trip in the mausoleum had lasted less than a minute. The Nigerians and I walked slowly along the foot of the Kremlin wall looking at the names of those interred there. We passed a bust of Stalin. We were still subdued. We kept thinking of what we had seen in the mausoleum. One of the Nigerians asked me if Lenin had had any children. I said that he had been married but — as I remembered it — he felt that his child was the Revolution. Anything else would have been a distraction.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; the Nigerian boxer said. &#8220;His great-grandchildren could drop in back there and see just how he looked.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of our tourist group was a stage-lighting technician from Minnesota. He told me he was curious to see how his fellow artists had (as he put it) &#8220;lit Lenin,&#8221; and he went to Red Square specifically to check up on them. He also had tickets to the Bolshoi Theater;<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-28"><sup id="ss-28">28</sup></a> he had hoped to get backstage to look at the lighting panels and the rest of the equipment but he had not been able to manage it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how did you think they lit Lenin?&#8221; I asked when I saw him.</p>
<p>He said he was much more impressed with the lighting in the mausoleum than what he had seen at the Bolshoi. &#8220;It&#8217;s a hard theater, that place, because you can&#8217;t do your lighting from the front. So they use follow-spots; the actors and dancers move around in pools of light. Some people like that, but I don&#8217;t: it&#8217;s too artificial. I was surprised how little subtlety there was — just blue, white, red, and bright yellow. Too much white, I thought, but then who am I to criticize? It&#8217;s the Bolshoi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Lenin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s just great, how they lit him. Really great,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A spot on his face, and one for each hand … against the black background … a little rose gel used, I&#8217;d guess … a smokey pink to give the effect of life … oh <i>very</i> well done. I wanted to crouch down and look up to see the spots and how they&#8217;d done it, but it&#8217;s not the sort of place you can stop to do that sort of thing, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>B. J. Phillips told me today that a Russian friend of hers had reported that the stones or markers over the bodies of Russian soldiers killed in Afghanistan bear the inscription &#8220;Died on International Duty&#8221; followed by the dates. The Russian was contemptuous of the phrase. He said, &#8220;For those who died in the Great Patriotic War the inscription was always &#8216;For the Motherland.&#8217; That meant something. But this new inscription — it is meaningless. Two of my friends from school are buried under it.&#8221; He had spat furiously at the grass.</p>
<p>In a Marxist society a considerable onus is put on being a servant or a waiter or anyone in a servile position. In Russia everyone wants to be an engineer. It takes forever to eat in a Moscow restaurant because whoever is supposed to appear at the table is back there in the kitchen pouting and banging the pots around, wondering what went wrong.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-29"><sup id="ss-29">29</sup></a> That is why one can wait for an hour in a restaurant, often falling asleep (the best position, I am told, is with the head on the table edge rather than lolling back in the chair, which is not as steady, and can result in toppling off with a crash) waiting for the aggrieved waiter to show up with a temper just barely under control. It does not help matters that no one can be fired.</p>
<p>These thoughts crossed my mind as I sat in the stands of Lenin Stadium watching the games, because obviously in athletic events there are many serviles — people who have to sweep the broad-jump pit, mop up the sweat if a basketball player tumbles to the court, carry out the weights for the weight lifters to heft, tote back the shot put for the shot-putters to put, and so forth.</p>
<p>I watched carefully, and noticed that the Soviet authorities have done their imaginative best to keep the serviles happy by making their work as mechanically oriented as possible. For example, when the javelins, discuses, and hammers land out at the far end of the pie-shaped target area, they are picked up by the serviles and carried off just a short distance to the side where the objects are attached with clips to a motorized cable contraption, which transports them back to the throwing area where another servile unhooks them and puts them in the proper racks. No one is embarrassed by having to walk a long distance carrying a ball with a chain on it. As for the shot, which doesn&#8217;t go as far as the other missiles, it is picked up and carried a few yards by the servile and settled into a long inclined trough, down which it rolls like a mammoth pinball, not propelled hard enough, returning back down the starting trough to the plunger.</p>
<p>I went to the weight-lifting events wondering if the great barbells were somehow going to be manipulated and shifted about by forklift trucks operated by men with engineering degrees. But no. To my surprise, the hefting is still done manually — by men wearing smart jumpsuits with a green arrow motif down the sleeves, often three of them at a time straining at the great weights. &#8220;Hernias,&#8221; we thought might be a good name for these specialists.</p>
<p>One wonders, in fact, if the Russians have not found exalted descriptives for those who perform menial tasks to take the sting out of what they do. For example, might not those who labor at the jumping pits in track and field, sweeping them smooth after a broadjumper has landed, be referred to as &#8220;earth restabilizers,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;sand agronomists&#8221;?</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I saw a man jump higher over a bar than anyone in history — seven feet, eight and three-quarters inches, an almost obscene height (I can just barely reach up that high). The man was an East German, Gerd Wessig, and when he had done it, he lay on his back on the blue, square mattress, itself about four feet thick so that jumpers don&#8217;t damage themselves on the way down from that prodigious height, and with his arms and legs akimbo, just as he had landed, he lay looking up into the pale evening sky for almost a minute, exulting, and letting the roar from the crowd wash over him. What a remarkable moment for him — to have done a simple act better than anyone else in the world! Above him, the bar, which had not even trembled as he had gone over it, must have seemed as solidly fixed as a tree branch.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-30"><sup id="ss-30">30</sup></a></p>
<p>We hear from travelers and tourists coming in from the West that in the press little play is being given to the games and such feats as Wessig&#8217;s.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-31"><sup id="ss-31">31</sup></a> There is much more coverage about the squabbling over the officiating, the alleged cheating, the food-throwing episodes in the Olympic Village disco, the lack of top-flight (i.e. U.S.) competition … almost as if the free-world press felt obliged to downgrade the Moscow show as much as possible.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-32"><sup id="ss-32">32</sup></a> Only three minutes of the games are available daily to the networks in the States. Some newspaper publishers are refusing to publish any accounts of the Olympics, making the games a nonevent and its participants nonpeople in the best tradition (if they thought about it) of the Soviet practice of manipulating history.</p>
<p>Very discouraging, this, and it made me remember Ralph Ellison inveighing against the side effects of the boycott in the civil rights struggle in the 1960s. When it was suggested that industrial companies with discriminatory practices should be publicly listed and their products boycotted in protest, Ellison argued persuasively that too many people who were not responsible would be affected and caused anguish and hardship.</p>
<p>Certainly one thing to be said about the boycott was that it made everyone feel punk and frustrated. It hadn&#8217;t changed anything. It demeaned without effect. It didn&#8217;t make anyone feel righteous or smug, unless they were prigs and had forgotten about Vietnam. It created division and confusion. This morning I had breakfast with a girl who was worried about what people would say back in the United States because she had come to Moscow to see the games. &#8220;Do you think they&#8217;ll say I&#8217;m a traitor?&#8221; she asked.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-33"><sup id="ss-33">33</sup></a></p>
<p>I watched her remove the top of her egg. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be all right this morning,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Yesterday, it was a one-minute egg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what they&#8217;re saying?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;re going to be called a traitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody in our tourist group is talking about it. The Russian salesgirls in the Gum department store said to Pat — you know Pat — how sorry they were that President Carter wasn&#8217;t going to let the tourists who came to the Olympics back into the United States. Where was she going to go, they wondered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can all go and live in Tashkent,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gorky&#8217;s more likely,&#8221; the girl said. &#8220;The Forbidden City — that&#8217;s what the Intourist guide calls the place. I&#8217;m depressed. If it weren&#8217;t for how nicely they&#8217;ve done this egg this morning, I&#8217;d cry.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>y the time Plimpton&#8217;s story ran, Carter&#8217;s gambit was being widely viewed as a diplomatic failure (it would be nearly a decade before the Soviets left Afghanistan). In practical terms, the lack of American involvement meant the 1980 Summer Olympics played as mostly a rumor in the United States. Without American stars like Edwin Moses, Mary Decker, and Craig Beardsley, the show didn&#8217;t go on, at least not in the United States. NBC had paid $87 million for the rights to the Games, but showed only a few highlights on <i>Today</i>.</p>
<p>When Plimpton returned from Moscow, he wanted to tell more of his experiences, and pitched the essay to his friend, Lewis Lapham, then early in the first of two stints as the editor of <i>Harper&#8217;s</i>. Lapham has few specific recollections of this story, but describes the typical process of editing Plimpton as being very simple. Plimpton would bicycle from his apartment on 72nd Street down near the <i>Harper&#8217;s</i> offices, on Park Avenue between 32nd and 33rd streets. &#8220;He usually dropped it off himself,&#8221; Lapham says. &#8220;Or we would meet for lunch someplace, and he would slide it across the table in a brown envelope.&#8221;<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-34"><sup id="ss-34">34</sup></a></p>
<p>Plimpton remained fascinated by the Olympics. He returned to the &#8217;84 Summer Games in Los Angeles, where he met his second wife, Sarah.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-35"><sup id="ss-35">35</sup></a> In 1996, he spent a day at the Olympic Games in Atlanta with President Clinton, and interviewed Clinton aboard Air Force One. Plimpton&#8217;s traveling companions, Wallace and Jordan, returned to Moscow this past August for the 2013 IAAF World Championships, to find it transformed. &#8220;Completely different city,&#8221; says Jordan. &#8220;Much more like Helsinki or even Berlin than the Moscow we visited in 1980.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Moscow in 1980 remains lost in a void, a missed opportunity, and one of the last major international sports events that went almost completely unseen in the United States. The veteran NBC announcer Charlie Jones, expressing the disappointment he felt for the athletes from boycotting countries, his colleagues, and himself, summed it up in 1988. &#8220;It&#8217;s history and you can&#8217;t change it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All you can do is cry in the dark.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In Sochi, a small group of soldiers with a complicated and violent history will be there to keep the peace at the Winter Olympics.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100272&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. In 2007, Vladimir Putin went to Guatemala to present Sochi’s bid to host the 2014 Winter Olympics to the International Olympic Committee himself. It was, for once, not an election he was expected to win. PyeongChang, South Korea, was the heavy favorite. Sochi was a seaside summer destination with no infrastructure, no venues, and often no snow.</p>
<p>Putin put on a tie — black with thin white stripes, knotted tightly — and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aNo3DxWaW4" target="_blank">delivered a speech</a>. “Mr. President,” he began, his Russian accent trampolining through the English words. “Members of the International Olympic Committee. Distinguished guests. Ladies and gentlemen.”</p>
<p>Sochi beat PyeongChang for the right to host the Games by four votes.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Sure, it’s easy to mock the pictures of Putin <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01962/p4_1962447c.jpg" target="_blank">arm wrestling</a> or <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/26/article-1306262-0AE9CF03000005DC-645_634x377.jpg" target="_blank">shooting whales</a> with a crossbow, or <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/12/worl-photo-caption-contest-shirtless-putin_n_3263512.html" target="_blank">riding on horseback</a> while shirtless, looking vaguely like a walrus on top of a horse.</p>
<p>But it’s hard not to be arrested by <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/images/2011/12/19/p233/111219_r21648_p233.jpg" target="_blank">his face</a> — the tiger’s head, the cat’s eyes. His skin emits a faint ectoplasmic glow.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Putin’s presence was the promise of his power.</p>
<p>“Real snow’s guaranteed,” he told the audience in Guatemala.</p>
<p>“We guarantee that the Olympic cluster in Sochi will be completed on time.”</p>
<p>“And one more special privilege: No traffic jams! I promise!”</p>
<p>He could do, he suggested, what mere leaders could not do.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The money was what mattered, of course. In Guatemala, Putin pledged $12 billion to transform Sochi from a summer resort into a winter one — far more than what South Korea and the third finalist, Austria, could spend. No one could doubt there would be more to come. In the end, Sochi’s price tag was more than $51 billion. The second-most expensive Games were the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, which cost an estimated $40 billion. One highway and railroad project in Sochi cost more than the entire 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver.</p>
<p>The numbers are unbelievable but not impossible. The Olympics are Putin’s priority.</p>
<p>Putin has encouraged a hierarchical system of patronage, transactional bribery, economic opportunity, and political authoritarianism that has made some people very, very rich and left those people very much in his debt. The oligarchs are free to enrich themselves, basically, as long as they understand that they are not free to challenge Putin — and as long as they open their purses when he asks. This doesn’t make him a second Stalin. He fits into a much longer pattern of Russian rule than that.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> After the vote, members of the IOC credited Putin’s appearance at the meeting for Sochi’s surprise win. “He worked very hard at it,” Jean-Claude Killy, a former skier, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/05/sports/05iht-SOCHI.4.6519083.html" target="_blank">told the <em>New York Times</em></a>. “He was nice. He spoke French — he never speaks French. He spoke English — he never speaks English. The Putin charisma can explain four votes.”</p>
<p>Putin was <em>nice</em>. Sochi was chosen to host the Winter Olympics, Killy was saying, because Putin flattered the members of the IOC. He shook their hands. When Vladimir Putin, perhaps the most powerful man in the world, said it was an honor to be there with them, he gave them a way to tell a story they wanted to tell about themselves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-100282" alt="Vladimir Putin Attends Youth Forum Seliger 2013" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/putin-cossacks-features.jpg?w=576&#038;h=335" width="576" height="335" /></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The story Putin wants to tell about himself, and by extension about Russia, involves a history that began long before the Soviet Union was formed and involves much more than Moscow. It stretches into Krasnodar, westernmost of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krai" target="_blank"><em>krais</em></a>, to the edges of Greater Russia, the old czarist empire.</p>
<p>Krasnodar Krai has the kind of eerie landscape that suggests the edges of things — rivers, lowlands, and steppes, and mountains emerging from sea. The mountains have the tumultuous outline of land that, with nowhere to go, rose up. UNESCO <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/900" target="_blank">has called the Western Caucasus</a> “one of the few large mountain areas of Europe that has not experienced significant human impact.”</p>
<p>Even pictures of the landscape, wild and unconstrained, suggest the history that haunts the place is not of the 20th century but the 19th. One can imagine rounding a bend in the mountains and coming across a man, strangely dressed, riding a horse, casting long shadows in dusty light.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> The Cossacks used to patrol this land, fierce soldiers on horseback. Just who the Cossacks were, was, and is hard to untangle, and always has been. Historians still debate to what extent they were an ethnic group or primarily a military caste. Their style was wild and their society egalitarian, and they left chaos in their wake. At the same time, they were associated with discipline. They were involved in rebellions against the czar, and yet they became his agents of conquest, increasingly incorporated into the military and Russian state. In 1860, Cossacks in the area where Krasnodar Krai now lies were organized into the Kuban Cossack Host, to settle and defend the Russian frontier in the Caucasus.</p>
<p>The Cossacks were both a manifestation of nationalism and also a distinct people with their own customs, at once manifestly Russian and strange. They became mythic figures, independent, strong, and free, representatives of natural nobility.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> In 1863, Leo Tolstoy published a short novel called <a href="http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780140449594,00.html" target="_blank"><em>The Cossacks</em></a>, in which a young aristocrat, wasting away in the debauchery of the cities, leaves Moscow to recover his spirit, to find “a life in which there would be nothing but happiness.” He goes to the Caucasus as a volunteer soldier and is drawn to the sensual world of the Cossacks, where men are adventurers, and it changes him.</p>
<p>“Suddenly he was gripped by such a strange feeling of groundless joy and love for everything that, in a habit he had had from childhood, he began crossing himself and expressing his thankfulness. He suddenly saw with the utmost clarity: ‘Here I am, Dmitri Olenin, so distinct from all other beings, and I am alone, God knows where, in the lair of a magnificent stag, who perhaps has never seen a man before, in a place where no man has ever been or thought such thoughts.’”</p>
<p>In one famous scene, a Cossack spots a Chechen disguised as a log in the river.</p>
<p>“‘Yes, it’s a Chechen all right!’ he thought with a surge of joy and, rising to his knees, once more took aim and peered at his target, just visible at the end of his long rifle. ‘In the name of the Father and the Son,’ he said, in the Cossack way he had learnt in his earliest years, and pulled the trigger.”</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> In their roles as the czar’s paramilitary, and as vigilantes, the Cossacks rampaged and spread terror. An American woman who traveled through Eastern Europe in 1815, following the path of Napoleon’s retreating soldiers and the Cossacks who chased them, wrote about seeing the blood drain from women’s faces when the Cossacks were mentioned. The French had been the invaders, and yet it was the Cossacks whom the women feared and hated. “The cruelties, and barbarities, of the Cossacks, seemed to have white washed all other crimes from their minds.” Over hundreds of years, the Cossacks fought Muslims as if it were a birthright. They murdered Jews with indiscriminate ferocity. The pogroms continued until the Russian Revolution. The Cossacks also took part in enforcing the Russian military’s expulsion and eradication of the Circassians from the region, in which hundreds of thousands, and possibly more, died.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Most of the Cossacks fought on the side of the White Russians during the civil war. When the Bolsheviks won, it became dangerous to be a Cossack. Many were killed and tens of thousands deported. “There was no legitimate way to express a Cossack identity during the second half of the 20th century,” said Brian Boeck, a Russian historian at DePaul University.</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Cossack way of life has begun to revive. After spasms of violence from the group’s more extremist elements in the early ’90s, much of the resurgence has centered on local cultures of dress, music, and dance. But in the past several years, and especially since Putin’s return to the presidency, the Cossacks have assumed a larger, semi-state-sponsored, semi-vigilante role in law enforcement. The Cossacks are associated with ultranationalism and a xenophobic strain of Russian identity.</p>
<p>“The feeling is, ‘Everything’s fallen apart and we need order,’” Eric Lohr, a professor of Russian history at American University, told me. “These are some of the same forces that swept in Putin.”</p>

<p><strong>11.</strong> More than <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d60a9994-a297-11e2-bd45-00144feabdc0.html" target="_blank">700,000 migrants came into</a> the Krasnodar region in 2012, according to the <em>Financial Times</em> — and that number was estimated to rise by 25 percent in 2013. Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/113248" target="_blank">has documented</a> widespread abuses of the migrant workers who came to build Olympic stadiums.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> In 2012, the governor of Krasnodar Krai, Aleksandr Tkachev, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/04/world/europe/russian-to-use-cossacks-to-repel-muslim-migrants.html" target="_blank">announced that</a> 1,000 Cossacks would be paid by the government to maintain public order. The influx of Muslims into the region was getting out of hand, he told law enforcement officers. “We have no other way — we shall stamp it out, instill order; we shall demand paperwork and enforce migration policies,” Tkachev told law enforcement officers during his announcement of the Cossack patrols.</p>
<p>“What you can’t do, the Cossacks can.”</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> Antiaircraft batteries are in the hills, countless surveillance cameras on the walls, warships off the coasts, X-rays at the checkpoints, policemen and soldiers on the streets. There are bomb-sniffers on leashes, machine guns in hands, wire around perimeters. There is an eavesdropping system everywhere, a Big Brother called SORM. Among the estimated 50,000 law enforcement officials will be around 400 Cossacks.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> The Cossacks can’t shoot anyone, because they aren&#8217;t carrying their guns. They can’t whip anyone, because they aren&#8217;t carrying their <em>nagaikas</em>, their horsewhips — leather braids as short and thick as a devil’s tail. They can inflict pain, no doubt; strong men need only fists. But they are not in Sochi to beat people up.</p>
<p>The Cossacks are at the Olympics to look like Cossacks. They have funny hats, tall shrubs of black sheep&#8217;s wool. Some of them wear gray greatcoats with stiff epaulets and jodhpurs that hang loose around their thighs. They are living anachronisms; they look good in photographs. They are not, says the historian Brian Boeck, there to remind people of pogroms. “The people who are making those decisions have an alternate memory of the past, in which the imperial moment is something to be proud of,” Boeck explained.</p>
<p>Still, they are meant to be menacing. They are there to make people feel their threat.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> There will be a little real snow — and enough man-made stuff to ski on. The Olympic cluster will be completed on time, at least enough for the cameras. There probably won’t be traffic jams, since, due to security concerns, only registered cars have been allowed in Sochi for a month.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> For Putin, the Olympics are a point of personal pride. Russia has a strong Olympic tradition, but this will be the first Winter Olympics held on Russian soil. Russia has hosted the Summer Olympics only once, in 1980 in Moscow, and the United States boycotted those Games.</p>
<p>Athletes come to the Olympics to compete with other athletes. They play sports — they play games. But the Olympics are not just about sports and games. The Olympics have always been a theater, a stage for dramas with competing scripts. The Olympics are a substitute for war and its analogue, a realization of both the cooperation and competition among nations. They are a celebration of peace. They are a test of power.</p>
<p>The Cossacks are patrolling the grounds and standing guard at venues, but they are playing a largely symbolic role. What that symbol is, and whom it’s directed at, and why they’re there at all are questions without clear answers. They are a symbol of freedom and rugged individuality, but also czarism. Their history is one of astounding violence, but they’re in Sochi unarmed. If there is a terrorist attack in Sochi, it’s hard to imagine what role a few hundred men wearing jodhpurs and not carrying guns can play. Still, they carry with them the suggestion of fear.</p>
<p>It’s an ironclad tenet of the IOC that politics has no part in the Olympic Games. But politics is the negotiation of power, and this Olympics, more than any other, is about power. A ski jump is a construction project. A hockey rink is a question of national honor. A security guard is a Cossack.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100272&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[That’s what Saturday night in February is. Saturday night in February is when Thursday night in March starts.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100153&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s one of those things that is cute about the Ivy League: Each school has a partner. This means that during the basketball season, a team goes on the road and plays a game Friday night, and then faces its opponent&#8217;s partner school on Saturday night; always the same two teams in tandem, since the dawn of trust funds. This being the Ivy League, all of the traveling is done by bus through the upper latitudes in winter. By popular acclaim, the worst road trip in the Ivy League is Columbia-Cornell, which requires a team to go from New York City to Ithaca, or vice versa, through the dark of a winter’s night. The second-worst is Harvard-Dartmouth.</p>
<p>What used to make up for the vast inconveniences of this annual tour of the Northeast’s finer highway rest areas was that the Harvard-Dartmouth swing provided the league’s traditional basketball powers, Penn and Princeton, with two guaranteed wins every year. (The dominance of those programs has been helped immeasurably by the fact that they are partners. In the Ivy League, the Penn-Princeton trip used to be a weekend in Mordor.) This is no longer the case. Over the weekend, Harvard solidified its place atop the Ivy League standings, squashing both of the visitors, each of whom also lost at Dartmouth because, what the hell, it’s the Ivy League. By far, Princeton was the tougher out. Penn had to get on a bus after losing to the Big Green, and the Quakers obviously left their legs, and most of their want-to, somewhere up Interstate 89 outside White River Junction. Over the last 11 minutes of the first half on Saturday night, Harvard outscored Penn 29-5 and <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400505956" target="_blank">rollicked and frolicked to an 80-50 win</a>. In the Ivy League, and especially at Harvard, this is why everybody talks about the importance of Saturday night. Saturday night is how you win the league, and get to go to the NCAA tournament, and <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330800167" target="_blank">beat New Mexico</a>, and make thousands of people in sports bars have the Scooby-Doo moment when the score comes across the crawl, and cause thousands of pool sheets to be thrown in the air. That’s what Saturday night in February is. Saturday night in February is when Thursday night in March starts.</p>
<p>“I was happy because we worked in practice about being good and up and ready for both nights,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker. “We made it a point in practice to emphasize how difficult it can be to play two nights in a row, especially that second night. That’s what we say — you win the league on Saturday night.”</p>
<p>If a team could win a whole league by the way it plays a single game, then Harvard could claim the Ivy title just with the ease by which it dispatched Penn. The Quakers are a better team than their 4-13 record would indicate, but they play with all the cool, disciplined focus of a food riot. The night before, Princeton made Harvard earn every last second of <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400505955" target="_blank">its 82-76 win</a>; Penn, however, simply wilted the first time the Crimson cranked up the volume, which Harvard can do in very entertaining fashion. Having lost its true inside presence, Kenyatta Smith, for the season <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/colleges/post/_/id/4621/notebook-harvard-hoops-hurting" target="_blank">with a foot injury</a>, Harvard continues to play fast and smart and very confidently, the last of which is personified best by Laurent Rivard, a 6-foot-5 guard from Saint-Bruno in Quebec, who can (and will) put it in the air from the Plains of Abraham if necessary. It was Rivard, whom Godard would have cast on sight, who put five 3-pointers on New Mexico in the tournament last year, who scored a combined 40 points on 11-for-19 from the floor in the weekend&#8217;s two games. Most of these came from spot-ups in transition, including a pair of 3-point shots that he hit in the nine minutes when the Penn game became ridiculous. “Laurent is a marksman,” Amaker said. “He’s that good a jump-shooter that he can change the dynamics of our team over a weekend. Now, he’s pretty much got the green light.”</p>
<p>“We have the machine going this year … so, if we have to play without Kenyatta, we have other players to go to without him,” Rivard said Friday night. “Coach always says this league is won on Saturday nights. If we win tomorrow, we’re on top alone. If we lose, we’re just back in the mix.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/harvard-shot-sl-features.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-100127" alt="Harvard-Shot-SL-Features" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/harvard-shot-sl-features.jpg?w=640&#038;h=360" width="640" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>Here are two stories about Harvard basketball that come from the days in which it did not beat Princeton and Penn on consecutive nights, and did not beat New Mexico in NCAA tournament games. The first comes from the early 1970s, when the school (briefly) attempted to bring its basketball team into the second half of the 20th century by recruiting actual basketball players. One of them was a star out of DeMatha Catholic High School, the longtime NBA prospect factory in Washington, D.C., named James Brown, whom you may see now on weekends in the fall, wrangling the <i>NFL Today</i> panel on CBS. Alas, Harvard was putting big-time talent in a small-time show. The Crimson still played up three flights in the old Indoor Athletic Building, in a big gym with arched windows that looked like the place where they trained the <a href="http://www.lipizzaner.com/" target="_blank">Lipizzaner stallions</a>. Anyway, in 1973, Brown’s senior year, the Crimson went 0-4 against Penn and Princeton, home and away, and that was pretty much that.</p>
<p>Six years later, the Harvard cocaptain was a tough point guard from Philadelphia named Glenn Fine. One night in December, 13-point underdogs against Boston College in the old Boston Garden, Fine and the Crimson played out of their shoes, taking a vastly more talented BC team to the wire before losing, 86-83. This game later became famous as one that Boston College players were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978%E2%80%9379_Boston_College_basketball_point_shaving_scandal" target="_blank">dumping on behalf of Henry Hill and his friends in New York</a>, who later became famous in the movie <em>Goodfellas</em>. Afterward, when nobody still knew anything about anything, and the BC players were collecting their money, Glenn Fine got a phone call telling him he’d been awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. Even though Harvard basketball doesn’t have a history, it still has history, because that’s the way things roll on that side of the Charles.</p>
<p>“I think anybody who’s been a part of this institution, or been around it, you’re in awe of it at times, because of the tradition, how far the arms can reach from this place,” said Amaker, who has spent his entire career in the service of high-end brands. He was a vital part of Mike Krzyzewski’s first great teams at Duke. Then, in 2001, after coaching at Seton Hall for four seasons, he moved along to Michigan, where the program was dead in the middle of the penalties levied as a result of the scandal that had its roots in the Fab Five days of the early 1990s. Amaker never really got his feet under him. He coached the Wolverines for six years and never made the tournament. Even if you’ve been spending time in NCAA supermax, that is how you lose your job at major programs. In 2007, then, Amaker signed aboard the oldest top-level brand in American higher education.</p>
<p>“You find out that, or you feel like, anything’s possible here,” he said. “We don’t sell, we present Harvard. We think it’s a life-changing opportunity … At times, it’s been magical, and not just here in the States, but globally. We built the program around that.”</p>
<p>He has also taken marvelous advantage of the inherent geopolitical advantages of a Harvard degree. In addition to Rivard, the gunner from La Belle Province, Amaker’s roster includes two other Canadians and a forward from Cameroon. “Because of the power of the brand, Harvard is used to greatness. The part that moves me the most about being here is that our basketball program, the energy and the excitement we’ve had, has energized our school,&#8221; Amaker said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m not sure we’ve ever been connected … I don’t know if some of the people who are interested have ever come to the games before. I don’t know if some of the members of our following have ever been in the same room together.”</p>
<p>They run and they gun and they have fun, and they’re not going to sneak up on anyone this spring. This probably will not be a good thing for Harvard, which won the weekend. You win on Saturday night because you win the league on Saturday nights. You win in February to play in March, especially in the Ivy League, which gets one bid to the tournament forever. You set yourself a number of little goals so as to reach one big one. “We beat Penn by 30,” said Kyle Casey, the merry 6-foot-7 center from down the highway in Medway, Massachusetts, who likely will carry most of the load inside the rest of the way. “I don’t think any Harvard team’s ever beaten Penn by 30. We’re the first one and, you know, it’s hard to do anything for the first time at Harvard.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100153&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith less than three weeks before the trade deadline, there is a sense around the league that the NBA landscape is under a constant humming tremor — the kind of soft rumbling that could result in a grand upheaval or fade away without a monster eruption.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already had six in-season trades, five of which were at least semi-significant, and everyone knows the various tankers will peddle their useful wares over the next two and a half weeks. The deeper rumble comes from the number of $10 million–plus contracts that could become available, due to underperformance, unexpected fit issues, buyer&#8217;s remorse, or some turn of events that has flipped a team&#8217;s long-term trajectory out of whack. But big contracts, even expiring ones, are very tough to move, and any chain reaction of such movement requires a trigger of one or two teams swallowing hard and leaping first.</p>
<p>The Nets just a month ago were an interesting candidate, an expensive disaster with two huge trade chips in Paul Pierce and Brook Lopez. Pierce&#8217;s $15 million expiring deal could fetch a productive player on a longer-term contract who is no longer wanted by another team, a general trade model the Nets will have to consider as long as they lack flexibility and draft picks. Lopez is done for the season, with a broken foot, and a &#8220;win now&#8221; team desperate for immediate gratification might deal an injured player for a healthy one.</p>
<p>But the Nets have improbably righted themselves. They&#8217;re 11-4 since the New Year behind weirdo small-ish lineups that have transformed an awful defensive team into a long-armed, turnover-generating machine. It required injuries, luck, and a midseason readjustment of the team&#8217;s core defensive principles, but the Nets appear to have stumbled upon that ephemeral thing every team seeks: an identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve found our personality,&#8221; says Nets GM Billy King.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to have a sense of structure and an identity,&#8221; says Jason Kidd, the team&#8217;s coach. &#8220;You have to know who you are, and how you&#8217;re going to play both ends. And now we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nets have little time to figure out whether this stretch is fool&#8217;s gold or indicative of a team that could be a problem in the postseason, when there are no back-to-backs to challenge old legs. That question touches on larger philosophical ones, including Lopez&#8217;s future and whether Brooklyn really should be in &#8220;win now&#8221; mode after a mega-trade intended to vault Brooklyn into the championship picture. The Nets are still far away from being a legitimate contender, but they are also capped out beyond hope, facing a repeater tax bill down the line, and they stand as perhaps the most asset-poor team in the league after trading three first-round picks to Boston over the summer.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-36"><sup id="ss-36">36</sup></a></p>
<p>Trading Lopez could theoretically work in both directions, though it would be painful for an organization that has nurtured his tremendous growth. Such a deal could leave Brooklyn with zero reliable bigs next season, since Kevin Garnett may retire and Andray Blatche has likely played his way into a better contract. Lopez is also dealing with his second major foot injury, which hurts his trade value. But the Nets have found an identity without him, and he&#8217;s a talented player with just two years left after this one<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-37"><sup id="ss-37">37</sup></a> on a fair contract. Brooklyn would have to at least consider calling, say, the Bobcats, <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNSteinLine/statuses/223113442519822338" target="_blank">a team that was ready to offer Lopez the max two summers ago</a>, and dangling Lopez in exchange for Ben Gordon&#8217;s expiring deal and two first-round picks. Such a deal would place the Nets back on a more &#8220;normal&#8221; course and minimize their chances of paying the dreaded repeater tax in 2015-16.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-38"><sup id="ss-38">38</sup></a> It might not work for Charlotte, which badly wants a playoff berth this season, but an injured Lopez could also work as a gamble for a tanking team happy to surrender something for a guy who won&#8217;t play this season. And it will be hard for the Nets to find a Lopez deal that doesn&#8217;t return either a player on an expiring contract who can walk in the summer, or one of those unwanted longer-term deals that would clog Brooklyn&#8217;s books.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-39"><sup id="ss-39">39</sup></a></p>
<p>King is fond of Lopez and says the team is not looking to deal him. But he also acknowledged the need to scrounge up some draft picks after sending so many to Boston. &#8220;We are not shopping Brook Lopez,&#8221; King told Grantland last week. &#8220;Our goal is to get Brook as healthy as possible. But if deals present themselves, we&#8217;ve got to look at them. If we can get draft picks back at some point, that would help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nets are not winning because Lopez is gone, but they are playing a style he&#8217;d be hard to fit into. Kidd has downsized, shifting Pierce to power forward and Garnett to center in hybrid lineups that are small up front and huge on the perimeter. The weirdness continues when Kidd goes to the bench with the positionally funky Andrei Kirilenko–Mirza Teletovic–Andray Blatche trio.</p>
<p>Teams have just had no idea how to handle these offbeat looks. Bigger power forwards struggle to chase Pierce around the perimeter, and some opponents have had a wing player guard Pierce while stashing the extra big on the nonthreatening Alan Anderson. But hiding a big that way becomes much harder if Deron Williams permanently replaces Anderson in the starting lineup. As for the bench, Kirilenko and Teletovic are both tweeners, but they have wildly different skill sets, and opponents often prefer to defend them with different players than Kirilenko and Teletovic guard on the other end. Kirilenko adds doses of speed and crazy that the slowpoke Nets sorely need, and he allows Brooklyn to let Teletovic launch on offense without worrying too much about the other end. Teletovic is jacking nine 3s per 36 minutes, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=per_minute&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;year_min=&amp;year_max=&amp;franch_id=&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;birth_country=&amp;is_active=&amp;is_hof=&amp;is_as=&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;qual=&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=1000&amp;c2stat=fg3a_per_mp&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=8.5&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;c5stat=&amp;c5comp=gt&amp;c6mult=1.0&amp;c6stat=&amp;order_by=ws" target="_blank">a launch frequency only four players have matched over a full season</a>. The Nets, basically, are dictating matchup confusion.</p>
<p>Kirilenko&#8217;s return to health has been essential to all of this. He can defend speedier wing players so that Teletovic doesn&#8217;t have to, and he allows for the demotion of both Anderson and Jason Terry — a rejiggering that lets Kidd experiment with absolutely giant lineups featuring Pierce or Joe Johnson at shooting guard.</p>
<p>The Nets would seem to be able to fit Lopez into all of this by starting him, keeping Pierce at power forward, and using Garnett off the bench as a backup center. It&#8217;s not as if Lopez would slow down a speedy Brooklyn attack; the Nets have averaged three fewer possessions per game over this hot 15-game stretch, per NBA.com. But basketball doesn&#8217;t work that easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that simple,&#8221; Kidd says. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the team with Brook is built to be a hybrid like this. Now we are, because we have no choice. We have a structure, and Brook going out has helped us define that.&#8221;</p>
<p>King is confident the Nets could play this way with Lopez, in part because of his shooting from the center spot. But even he acknowledges meshing everyone and staying &#8220;small&#8221; would be a challenge. &#8220;Brook is a great scorer,&#8221; King says, &#8220;but now, when we&#8217;re smaller, defensively we are a little better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ironically, Lopez figured into the reconstruction of the Nets&#8217; defense, a slow and painful process that began after Sacramento blew them out in mid-November, Kidd says. The coaching staff decided after that game that they wanted to defend more aggressively. That meant two major things:</p>
<p><strong>1. Kidd wanted his big men to step farther out in containing pick-and-rolls.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/nets1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-100041" alt="NETS1" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/nets1.png?w=1024&#038;h=503" width="1024" height="503" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/nets2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-100042" alt="NETS2" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/nets2.png?w=1024&#038;h=481" width="1024" height="481" /></a></p>
<p>This is somewhere between a hard trap and a softer defense in which the big man drops back near the foul line, a style the Nets had been playing earlier in the season. The Nets call this &#8220;up to touch,&#8221; meaning the big man should be able to touch the screener at the start of the play, Kidd says. Lopez, a plodding dude, would seem an ill fit for this kind of style, but when the coaches used film to demonstrate the proper technique to the team, they used film of Lopez executing it. &#8220;Brook can do this,&#8221; Kidd says. &#8220;He was doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garnett has looked more spry over the last month.</p>
<p>Blatche tries, but he’s never going to be a good defender; that said, he has been playing better since missing four games due to “personal reasons.”</p>
<p>The other players are so close in size that they can switch on almost any pick.</p>
<p><strong>2. The rest of the defenders have taken a step closer to the middle of the floor, walling off the paint and generally scrunching things up.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/nets3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-100043" alt="NETS3" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/nets3.png?w=1024&#038;h=480" width="1024" height="480" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/nets4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-100044" alt="NETS4" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/nets4.png?w=1024&#038;h=450" width="1024" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about starting off in the right spot,&#8221; Kidd says, &#8220;and pulling the help defenders in on the weak side.&#8221;</p>
<p>The goal is to close off the first option and force teams to swing the ball around the perimeter in search of something else. It&#8217;s also a way the Nets can help Pierce deal with tough post-up bigs — by having help defenders ready, in the paint, right behind him. Sending all five defenders toward the ball like this carries a risk: Great passing teams stocked with shooters can draw the Nets in, and then fling the ball around fast enough to beat the defense before it can recover out. The Nets are betting they can win more of those possession-by-possession battles than they lose, and they have been right over the last month.</p>
<p>Brooklyn is 10th in points allowed per possession since January 1, a massive jump for a team that ranked 29th up to that point, per NBA.com. They have forced turnovers on 18.6 percent of opponent possessions since January 1, tops in the league, and a number that would have led all defenses last season. About 12 percent of opponent possessions have ended via isolation plays, per Synergy Sports, a share that would easily be the league&#8217;s highest over the full season. That suggests the Nets have been successful in denying the first option, leaving teams to improvise one-on-one as the shot clock ticks down.</p>
<p>The Nets aren&#8217;t the fastest or most athletic group, but they are long, and this system is a way to leverage that length. Shaun Livingston and Joe Johnson are long for their positions, and Livingston especially has been able to sink into the paint as a helper, dart out when the offense kicks the ball back to his side of the floor, and swipe those cross-court passes opponents wrongly think are safe.</p>
<p>Johnson has gotten some steals this way and has generally been steady as a defender. Blatche&#8217;s hands are quick enough to pick a point guard&#8217;s pocket or reach into passing lanes at the right times. Kidd has allowed for some selective gambling, and the team as a whole has just been in tune with this scheme. They are &#8220;on a string,&#8221; covering for each other in sync as the ball and help assignments shift around the floor, and they have a very good sense of personnel — which shooters demand a bit more attention away from the ball, and which can be ignored more blatantly. &#8220;Our length is big for us,&#8221; Kidd says. &#8220;And we have guys with very high basketball IQs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The success has been encouraging, but also much more consistent against the average-or-worse offenses Brooklyn faced in this stretch — New York, Orlando, Cleveland, Boston. The better offensive teams have generally scored well against Brooklyn, though the Nets can point to strong defensive performances against Oklahoma City on the road, Miami (missing Dwyane Wade, Shane Battier, and Mario Chalmers), and Golden State (playing on the second end of a back-to-back, and at the end of a long road trip). That kind of mixed record is to be expected; good teams beat up on the sad sacks and split games against the other good teams.</p>
<p>Are the Nets actually good? They&#8217;ve figured out some things on defense and installed more continuity-based sets on offense, which have helped goose the team&#8217;s scoring and 3-point attempts. They&#8217;ve outscored opponents by 3.5 points per 100 possessions over the last month, a solid mark, but not one we&#8217;d associate with a contender. They&#8217;re still just 21-25, hoping to limp into at least the no. 6 spot and avoid the Miami/Indiana duo for one merciful round. Kirilenko is already hurting again, Johnson&#8217;s knee is balky, and Williams&#8217;s ankles are a never-ending mess. Teams have hit a scorching 46.4 percent on corner 3s against Brooklyn even in these solid 15 games, suggesting the pack-the-paint defense has a price.</p>
<p>The Nets still must look in the mirror and see a team in need of more talent and draft picks to make any real noise in the playoffs this season and beyond. They could use another wing player, and they have both an open roster spot and a disabled-player exception the league granted after Lopez&#8217;s season-ending injury.</p>
<p>They should listen to any offer for Williams or Johnson, though no good one is likely to come. Lopez is more interesting, but finding immediate on-court help will be hard. The likeliest player return would be someone else&#8217;s unwanted long-term money or an expiring contract, with Pau Gasol the most oft-mentioned candidate among rival executives. But the Lakers want to maintain max-level cap space, and they couldn&#8217;t do so while adding Lopez.</p>
<p>Pierce&#8217;s contract might offer more options, but carries its own complications. Things might be different if the Nets were sure Garnett planned to retire in the offseason, wiping away his $12 million salary, but they have no such certainty. Replacing Pierce with a big salary that carries into next season means another year of mammoth tax bills, and while the Russian ownership is willing to pay such bills, they are not stoked about paying them to acquire someone like Carlos Boozer.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-40"><sup id="ss-40">40</sup></a></p>
<p>Pierce&#8217;s contract is huge, and the Nets are so far into the tax that swapping Pierce for a more expensive contract might be a no-go. The Nets could search out a team in need of long-term payroll relief and try to flip Pierce for multiple pieces; the Nuggets could hit the reset button by sending the Nets a package like Wilson Chandler, J.J. Hickson, and Professor Andre Miller, PhD, in exchange for Pierce.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-41"><sup id="ss-41">41</sup></a> But that kind of fit is difficult, since lots of such teams are close enough to the tax line that taking on Pierce&#8217;s salary is tricky.</p>
<p>The Nets, for now, are happy to have found some stability. &#8220;The great thing about this is that for so long, we were at the center of trade rumors,&#8221; King says. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s kind of nice that we&#8217;re not. We have a core group here now.&#8221; But they know there is a lot of hard work that remains.</p>
<h2>10 Things I Like and Don&#8217;t Like</h2>
<p><strong>1. Unexpected answers</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s so great when a player or coach gives you a totally unexpected answer. During our sit-down last week, I asked Kidd what surprised him about the life of a head coach after having been in the league as a player for so long. I expected something about the all-consuming schedule, player relations, or the New York media spotlight.</p>
<p>I got this: &#8220;You don&#8217;t need an alias.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wait, what? Like at hotels? &#8220;Yeah. Most players have aliases. Coaches don&#8217;t need aliases&#8221;</p>
<p>But you&#8217;re Jason Kidd! You&#8217;re famous! You&#8217;re not some grunt from the video room! &#8220;They don&#8217;t bother the coaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t ask Kidd what his preferred alias was as a player. Can&#8217;t believe I dropped the ball on that follow-up. I hope to rectify it soon.</p>
<p><strong>2. Bank-shot cool</strong></p>
<p>Some players laugh and shake their heads when they accidentally bank in a straight-on jumper. They acknowledge their good fortune. Guys in the too-cool-for-school crowd just backpedal to the defensive end, stone-faced and all business, pointing out defensive assignments in an exaggerated style that says, &#8220;EVERYTHING IS TOTALLY NORMAL; LOOK AT ME PLAYING DEFENSE NOW.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those guys are no fun.</p>
<p><strong>3. LeBron&#8217;s defense</strong></p>
<p>It has been documented already, but it&#8217;s worth mentioning in this space: LeBron is having a down year defensively. His block and steal numbers are at a career low, sophisticated adjusted plus/minus systems aren&#8217;t kind to him, he can be downright Wadeian in his halfhearted transition defense, and he and his Miami teammates will carelessly swap assignments on the weak side when no such swap is really necessary.</p>
<p>Some of that smacks of a regular-season malaise that will correct itself when Miami feels like caring again. But he hasn&#8217;t been quite as airtight defending dribble drives against other perimeter stars, even when he dials up the intensity — as he did last week against Oklahoma City. Kevin Durant blew by LeBron several times one-on-one, and though the threat of Durant&#8217;s shooting forced LeBron to press him tightly, Durant wasn&#8217;t the first guy this season to get around LeBron with surprising ease. Worth monitoring.</p>
<p>Side note: It was telling that Oklahoma City split the LeBron assignment among three different players (Durant, Thabo Sefolosha, and Perry Jones), while Miami could only count on LeBron to guard Durant.</p>
<p><strong>4. Clear path reviews</strong></p>
<p>These are just endless, and often unnecessary. Clear path fouls are often obvious in real time, and if the NBA really wants to weed them out, just automate a harsh penalty for intentional fouls that disrupt fast breaks. Two shots and the ball might work.</p>
<p><strong>5. J.R. Smith heaves</strong></p>
<p>You can criticize Smith for a lot of things: shot selection, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/j-r-smith-apparently-drives-450-000-armored-153413171.html" target="_blank">taste in cars</a>, recreational drug use in the face of league rules that prohibit it, <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/3/10/2860993/j-r-smith-fine-tweet-photo-new-york-knicks" target="_blank">Twitter misbehavior</a>, his over-the-top reaction to the Knicks cutting his brother, shot selection, defense, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5986076/ladies-jr-smiths-twitter-come+on-will-have-you-sopping-wet" target="_blank">&#8220;get the pipe,&#8221;</a> and shot selection.</p>
<p>But make sure to praise the man for his unwavering commitment to half-court heaves at the end of quarters. Way too many players knowingly hold the ball a tick too long before launching, hoping to save their precious field goal percentage from the tiny dip a miss would bring. Smith doesn&#8217;t give a crap. He&#8217;s gunning for glory, and he practices half-court shots before every game.</p>
<p>This is the upside to having no conscience.</p>
<p><strong>6. Lance Stephenson&#8217;s entry passing</strong></p>
<p>Stephenson has turned this into a real asset on a post-heavy team that needs good entry passers. He&#8217;s become precise at passing over fronts, even from tricky diagonal angles, and he does so with just the right trajectory and pace to squeeze the ball between defenders. An underrated skill, and something Stephenson has clearly worked hard to improve.</p>
<p><strong>7. The giddy Steve Albert</strong></p>
<p>Albert, the Suns&#8217; play-by-play guy (and Marv&#8217;s brother), was staring at watching 82 games of a terrible basketball team and trying to come up with things to talk about. But to his surprise, he&#8217;s broadcasting <a href="http://grantland.com/features/from-the-ashes/" target="_blank">a winner</a> playing with delightful pace and the spunky fight of an underdog. He&#8217;s damn near giddy about Phoenix&#8217;s season. You could almost see the smile beaming across his face last week as he narrated Goran Dragic&#8217;s artful, fearless rim attacks against Roy Hibbert. The man is having a great time.</p>
<p><strong>8. The gravity of Kevin Love</strong></p>
<p>It can be hard to understand the impact of a knockdown shooter when he doesn&#8217;t actually shoot the ball, but Minnesota&#8217;s offense makes functional use of the attention Kevin Love draws as a decoy. Here&#8217;s one simple set the Wolves feature, starting with Love and Nikola Pekovic at the elbows and Ricky Rubio up top:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ofmP0pvX4xg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Did you catch what happened there? Rubio runs a pick-and-roll with Love at the left elbow, but Love&#8217;s man, LaMarcus Aldridge, doesn&#8217;t dare help contain Rubio&#8217;s dribble drive — the big man&#8217;s normal job here.</p>
<p>Instead, the Blazers, having scouted this play, decide Robin Lopez should abandon Pekovic at the opposite elbow, scurry across the lane on a diagonal, and challenge Rubio at the basket. That leaves Pekovic open for an easy layup.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the same basic set, and the same basic defensive reaction, only Rubio gets the finish this time:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/UyWPV_j3-Ps?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>9. Ramon &#8220;Sesh&#8221; Sessions</strong></p>
<p>Steve Martin, Charlotte&#8217;s play-by-play guy, is a gem, but something about this nickname for Ramon Sessions rubs me the wrong way. It might be an involuntary reflex stemming from my history nerd-dom, since it immediately makes me think of Union soldiers referring to Confederates (and their backers) as &#8220;secesh&#8221; — short for &#8220;secessionist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have problems, I realize.</p>
<p><strong>10. Ty Lawson&#8217;s patience in the lane</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of Sessions: I&#8217;ve long admired his patience as a ball handler in the lane, an area where patience would seem a rare virtue for the NBA&#8217;s smaller guards. Large men with long arms are converging on them with bad intentions, and the three-second countdown is under way.</p>
<p>But Sessions has used awkward pauses and pump fakes under the hoop to draw fouls, and Ty Lawson, an even speedier and littler dude, is adding the same kind of nuance to his game:</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/hMZDPGsu0N4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Great stuff for a guy who would be an All-Star in the Eastern Conference.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100040&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Thursday, Jay Leno will no longer be the host of <i>The Tonight Show</i>.</p>
<p>You’re likely already aware of this, though you probably don’t care either way. Even if you regularly watch <i>The Tonight Show</i>, or appreciate Leno as a teller of topical jokes, his departure might not feel like a particularly momentous occasion. When Steve Kroft prefaced a recent <i>60 Minutes</i> report by noting that Leno is one of the five most popular people on television, his intention was to illustrate that Leno (either by choice or network decree) is leaving his job prematurely. But in reality it showed how <i>The Tonight Show</i> has been diminished as an institution since Leno took over the show 22 years ago. Throughout the ’70s and ’80s, it was accepted as fact that Johnny Carson was the biggest TV star on the planet. He was more recognizable than virtually all the guests who sat in the chair adjacent to his desk. When he retired in 1992, Carson could walk into any grocery store in America and make Tom Cruise look like a checkout clerk. Leno can’t stack up against that kind of mythic, old-world star power. He barely stacks up against four other contemporary TV personalities.</p>
<p>A lot of that isn’t his fault. It’s just the way things are now. Guys<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-42"><sup id="ss-42">42</sup></a> like Leno are hardly seen on TV anymore. Late-night shows are experienced by most viewers the following morning via two- and three-minute bite-size pieces in people’s social media feeds. Using Nielsen ratings as a metric, <i>The Tonight Show</i> remains the most successful program in late night. But when was the last time you saw one of Leno’s bits retweeted into your feed? Have you <i>ever</i> seen one? If so, who in the hell are you following? Leno is about as viral-friendly as any doddering midsize metro daily newspaper columnist. (This explains his fascination with wacky headlines.)</p>
<p>Now, if you do have any discernible emotional reaction to Leno’s departure, I’m guessing that it falls somewhere between “relief” and “spite-fueled glee.” While Leno certainly has his partisans, the most passionate responses to his workmanlike comedy gruel have come from those who have long taken his very existence as an affront. Even as Leno has faded as a high-profile media figure to the point of virtual invisibility for anyone born after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Late_Shift_(book)" target="_blank"><i>Late Shift</i> era</a>, he remains a symbol of generational privilege for the People Who Followed the Boomers.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-43"><sup id="ss-43">43</sup></a> Hating Jay Leno, particularly for people in their thirties and forties (old enough to actually kind of care about who hosts <i>The Tonight Show</i>, but young enough to still be sort of vain about appearing “hip” and “edgy”), is what makes Leno seem more important than he really is. Now that his tenure at <i>The Tonight Show</i> is nearly complete, it’s what Leno represents that looms largest.</p>
<p>Kroft rightly seized upon this as the framework for Leno’s <i>60 Minutes</i> profile, but only (again) in a wrongheaded, bizarro-world sense.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-44"><sup id="ss-44">44</sup></a> The crux of the <i>60 Minutes</i> story is that Leno was “pushed aside for a younger generation,” a view Leno himself appears to support based on how the interview is edited. That assertion is absolutely correct, by the way, though the tone of the piece is clearly disapproving of these developments. It starts with a Leno sound bite about how in show business, “you are going to get screwed,” and from there pads a one-sided puff piece with a series of passive-aggressive quotes from Leno for the next 13 minutes. When Leno pays lip service to Jimmy Fallon’s qualifications, and Kroft points out the obvious about how Leno said the same about Conan O’Brien when NBC “pushed him aside” 10 years ago, Leno (too cutely) replies, “Well, we’ll see what happens.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, media critics instantly integrated the interview into the same “Why won’t he just leave already?” narrative that was predominant during Leno’s battles with O’Brien in 2009 and ’10. Echoing the sentiments of many TV writers, <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/leno-needs-to-lie-better-about-leaving-tonight.html" target="_blank">Vulture’s Joe Adalian argued</a> that Leno’s unconvincing ceding to Fallon was hurting his good name. “He should play as many stand-up dates as he wants, touring till he drops. But for the sake of his own legacy, February 6 should mark the end of his TV-talk-show career,” Adalian writes.</p>
<p>I would argue that “Why won’t he just leave already?” <i>is</i> Leno’s legacy, and that the constant drama-queening his haters blast him for is a two-way street. As a longtime Leno loather, let me cop to this: I won’t miss his show, but I will miss <i>complaining</i> about his show. Leno, self-consciously or not, played a great heel, and people my age relished every hiss and boo we spat at him.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: Any semblance of cultural resonance that <i>The Tonight Show</i> has is gone after Thursday. That doesn’t mean Jimmy Fallon won’t be good — I think he will be — just that his relative goodness or badness won’t have any greater meaning. It will just be another TV show. Love him or (especially) hate him, Leno was the only reason <i>The Tonight Show</i> mattered even the tiniest bit. My generation has been defined by its antipathy toward boomers, and Leno is the Coca-Cola of boomer culture.</p>
<p>Leno not being around anymore to bitch about makes me downright melancholy. I want him on that Burbank stage. I <i>need</i> him on that Burbank stage. Because I can see where this story is headed once he’s gone, and what it means for people like me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>In 2010, right in the middle of the media feeding frenzy over Leno’s <i>Tonight Show</i> “coup” against O’Brien, Patton Oswalt <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/01/12/obrien-refuses-to-follow-leno-celebrities-take-sides/" target="_blank">appeared on the Comedy Bang! Bang! podcast</a> (back when it was Comedy Death-Ray Radio) and compared Jay Leno to Richard Nixon. Obviously, he didn’t mean it as a compliment. Comparing anyone to Nixon is like the morphine alternative to a Hitler comparison. It won’t get the accuser entangled in a potentially lethal Godwin’s law violation, but it still totally fucks up whoever is being administered the dose.</p>
<p>Oswalt’s reasoning was sound. Like Nixon, Leno is an all-time talent in his field and unquestionably skilled, but ultimately hampered by insecurity and an insatiable drive to assuage that insecurity with constant approval from the American public, regardless of who gets hurt in the process. Like all of Leno’s critics, Oswalt made sure to point out that Leno was once known as perhaps the most respected road comic in America. It sounds like praise, but it’s always brought up to condemn Leno. It’s like explaining how adorable a former child star used to be to illuminate how hideous the person in question became as an adult.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Oswalt’s most serious charge against Leno is that “he willfully shut that switch off” once he got Carson’s job. The implication is that Leno pandered to the public’s basest instincts in Nixonesque fashion (at the expense of people like David Letterman and O’Brien) to consolidate his power.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-99938" alt="The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/leno-letterman-features.jpg?w=576&#038;h=388" width="576" height="388" /></p>
<p>I wasn’t hanging out at comedy clubs in the ’70s and ’80s, so if people who were there say that Jay Leno was the funniest man alive back then, I’ll take their word for it. But judging by the YouTube clips I recently watched of Leno’s celebrated mid-’80s appearances on Letterman’s <i>Late Night</i> show, the old young Jay isn’t that dissimilar from current old Jay. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fec-l5qXxw" target="_blank">Here</a>, you can see him always pushing hard to the next joke, favoring the security of a prepared act to the uncertainty of real human interaction.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-45"><sup id="ss-45">45</sup></a> He’s a little more natural in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZZ3DY3x1pE" target="_blank">this clip</a>, bantering with Dave about working as a foot soldier in the trenches of clubs in Middle America while his old Comedy Store pal Letterman sits like a general behind a GE-owned desk. But Leno still seems much older than Letterman, even though Letterman is actually three years his senior. The latter is thoroughly postmodern, surveying Leno’s hammy gesticulations and punched-up laugh lines with detached amusement. The former is the embodiment of old-time showbiz, a real hoofer, constantly reminding you of how hard he’s pounding the floorboards to get a goddamn laugh already.</p>
<p>Watching these old <i>Late Night</i> shows reminded me why I responded to Letterman so strongly as I entered my teen years in the early ’90s. Just as <i>The Simpsons</i> did around the same time, Letterman confirmed that you were smart and “correct” for believing that mainstream pop culture was imbecilic. A person like Letterman trained you to see through people like Leno. He made you want to be the guy who silently mocked the other guy for trying so hard to fit in.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-46"><sup id="ss-46">46</sup></a></p>
<p>As annoying as Leno is in these clips, his oft-praised work ethic and dedication to his craft are impossible to miss. If you’re inclined to view Leno at all sympathetically, even the Nixon comparison isn’t all bad. In an earlier <i>60 Minutes</i> piece from 1992, pegged to the start of Leno’s <i>Tonight Show</i> reign, his wife, Mavis, shares a painful anecdote from Leno’s days as a budding movie star in the ’80s, when a casting director rejected him before putting out a call for a “good-looking Jay Leno.” Since then, Leno’s job has been threatened by a hostile media and rivals who were either cuter (like Fallon) or more respected for their intellectual, Ivy League pedigree (like O’Brien). His only salvation has been the support of a “silent majority” resentful of the cultural changes that Leno provided a bulwark against.</p>
<p>Those people aren’t just going to disappear once Leno leaves, though they might as well evaporate as far as most of the media are concerned. Watching Leno’s <i>60 Minutes</i> profile, I was struck by its perspective: It is maybe the only piece of reporting I’ve ever seen that was clearly done from a Conan-averse, boomer-centric point of view. Explicitly, it’s a piece about an icon (maybe) exiting pop culture; implicitly, it’s about the phasing out of a dominant media perspective. It’s not just that Leno is being pushed aside. His audience is, too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>This is the part where I’m supposed to be smug. We won! Grandpa is finally giving us the keys to his shiny media machine! The new host of <i>The Tonight Show</i> has rapped with Justin Timberlake and thinks <i>Full House</i> jokes are funny! Those generational signifiers will never grow tired among the People Who Follow Our Generation!</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>If I can reference a seminal event for individuals in my demographic group that occurred a quarter-century ago, the end of Leno is like the fall of communism in Russia. It’s a destabilizing event that signals larger changes that will irrevocably alter how we see the world. It might take awhile to feel the aftershocks in the media landscape, but they’re coming. Yes, there’s a TV special airing on Sunday commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Beatles performing on Ed Sullivan. But the future belongs to Nirvana retrospectives. While the original Woodstock turns 45 this summer, I suspect it will be overshadowed by remembrances of Fred Durst’s sociopathic behavior at Woodstock ’99. Moving forward, Leno will be memorialized by the very people inclined to perceive him (at best) as out of touch and (at worst) cretinous.</p>
<p>Everything is different now. Except it’s really not.</p>
<p>After all, Leno himself once signified a younger generation that “pushed aside” Carson. And then he got old. Everybody gets old. Generational wars aren’t won on the basis of better ideas or funnier jokes. They are rigged contests that favor the young 100 percent of the time. But only in the short term. Eventually, we all get thrown over a cliff. So, congratulations, my brethren. After Thursday, we’re next on the chopping block.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=99930&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a season of #brands in an age of listicles. Outside the Disney Store on Seventh Avenue (disclaimer: Grantland is owned by Disney), college kids in Broncos jerseys were taking selfies with a panhandler who wore a Guy Fawkes mask and held a cardboard sign that said &#8220;NEED MONEY FOR WEED.&#8221; Cell phones were doing something to our brains and flashing lights were doing something to our brains and drugs were doing something to our brains and football was doing something to our brains, and the Super Bowl, the apex of most of that list, was this week in New York, the apex of all of it. I had begun to wonder whether the Super Bowl was still capable of being experienced, whether it was possible to catch any glimpse, through all the layers of mediation and hysteria surrounding the event, of the event itself. Skepticism was of no use. To complain that the Super Bowl had become a meta-corporate spectacle was only to enter through a different door into the hall of mirrors of replication and cliché. It looked to me as though the Super Bowl either had become or was on the verge of becoming the first great American non-experience. And because this seemed as important as anything at the start of 2014, I found myself, on a warm Sunday afternoon in winter, riding a bus toward MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where the AFC champion Denver Broncos were playing the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks, to try to experience it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/times-square-sb-sl-features.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-99749" alt="Times-Square-SB-SL-Features" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/times-square-sb-sl-features.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=576" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;No bags! Media members with no bags! You do not have to be dog-sniffed! Step over here! We appreciate you!&#8221; I am waiting in the line for Security Detection Gate 5 in the Media Entrance Pavilion. The Syracuse marching band is here, filing through metal detectors. The human security guards are wearing red windbreakers with &#8220;S.A.F.E.&#8221; printed on the back, and the bomb-sniffing dogs are wearing little black coats with &#8220;DO NOT PET&#8221; written on them. The bomb-sniffing dogs are pacing casually, noses down, around piles of laptop cases the ladies and gentlemen of the press have been instructed to stow at the official bomb-sniffing platform. Every now and again, a lady or gentleman is caught taking a photo of the security pavilion and pulled to the side by one of the S.A.F.E. guards, who orders the lady-slash-gentleman to delete said photo before rejoining the line. One of the S.A.F.E. guards has a megaphone, and periodically he&#8217;ll yell, &#8220;No photography in the tent!&#8221; But it&#8217;s hard to hear anything over the ambient din of security being done.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an air of tension in here, mostly because the line isn&#8217;t moving and if it doesn&#8217;t start soon, we&#8217;re going to miss the Snickers pregame warm-up. The Syracuse band is at the only metal detector where there&#8217;s any action at all, and at one point, for reasons that never quite coalesce, I am ordered by a guard to leave my line and take a spot among the Orange baton twirlers, which I do gracefully, bidding a silent farewell to my old life. The other baton twirlers open a space for me without being asked. But I&#8217;m there for less than 20 seconds before a second guard swoops down and tells me in his not-fucking-around voice that I am <i>not</i> a baton twirler and do <i>not</i> belong where I&#8217;m standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>Bert and Juliet<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-47"><sup id="ss-47">47</sup></a> stop me outside the arena and ask if I&#8217;ll take their picture in front of a giant poster of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Lombardi Trophy — the real thing — is on display in a pavilion across the concourse, but too many people want their photos with it, they&#8217;ve shut the doors, so Bert and Juliet are settling for the poster. They&#8217;re Seattle fans, mid-fifties-ish. Head-to-toe Seahawks gear, and if this isn&#8217;t an axiom, it should be: Find an adult wearing team-branded pants and you have found a legitimate fan. They&#8217;re in town just for the game and they&#8217;re doing it up right; they&#8217;ve been shopping at the memorabilia stalls outside MetLife for so long that they&#8217;re each carrying two big paper bags, which Juliet needs time to hide before we can snap the photo. &#8220;It&#8217;s too much,&#8221; she says, but the idea is that this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and they never want to forget it. She&#8217;s grinning. &#8220;Coming to the Super Bowl … it&#8217;s just so much <i>stuff</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour before game time, the temperature stands in the high 40s, but the walkways are lined with dozens of tall, thin gas burners, actual pillars of fire. People are drifting around between the general admission gates and the exterior food and beer kiosks. There are hyperrealistic headless NFL bodies in action poses scattered around, in case you want to have your picture taken with your head in the (missing) head&#8217;s place. To accomplish this, you have to climb onto the back of the headless body in what is itself not an unathletic move, standing on the white plastic toeholds gouged into the body&#8217;s calves and clinging to the body&#8217;s shoulders with your head sort of scrunched down and your butt pushed out. For the world&#8217;s premier multimedia spectacle, outdoor entertainment is kind of thin on the ground at the Super Bowl. Headless NFL body-climbing is a popular activity. Most of the bodies have lines.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>A redheaded bearded guy in a Broncos jersey is jumping underneath the giant Roman numerals outside the stadium. It&#8217;s a New York jump, a &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna make it!&#8221; jump, the sort of jump you&#8217;d see freeze-framed at the end of ’70s sitcom credits. His friend is taking iPhone photos of this, using burst mode, standing way off in front of the &#8220;V&#8221; in &#8220;XLVIII.&#8221; They need only one photo, but they try five or six times. If you want precisely that ’70s-TV quality of spontaneous, independent, doing-it-my-way joy, you have to be prepared to work at it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/seahawks-fan-sl-features.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-99747" alt="Seahawks-Fan-SL-Features" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/seahawks-fan-sl-features.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=576" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>The players take the field to a fizzy spray of fireworks and booming rhythmic gouts of fire that spurt from team- and league-branded pyro boxes stationed a safe distance from each team&#8217;s entrance tunnel. The Seahawks&#8217; pyro box is neon green, and the Broncos&#8217; is screaming orange. Squads of guys in black smocks, like the puppeteers in a Bunraku drama, move around unnoticed, wheeling components of the blue stages for the performers of the patriotic songs. Each squad has an unencumbered advance scout running in front of it and hand-signaling information about the squad&#8217;s upcoming path to the scouts of the other squads. I imagine the horrific pileups that would result if the scouts weren&#8217;t down there hand-signaling. I&#8217;m up in my seat at the auxiliary press table, section 101, row 43, behind the Seahawks&#8217; end zone. It&#8217;s scorching up here because the Arctic Retribution panic of recent weeks has moved the organizers to install a glowing bank of orange heat lamps on the ceiling directly above the auxiliary press, and now artificial heat is beating down and the auxiliary press are slowly broiling to death. Sweat beads auxiliary foreheads. Auxiliary laptops are one tap of the Enter key shy of bursting into flames. On the field, a group of red-blazered handlers has unrolled an enormous American flag and the stage squads have assembled their stage components and soprano Renée Fleming comes out to sing the national anthem.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t hear anything from up here, because you can hear everything from up here. There&#8217;s the press box announcer and the main stadium announcer and the audio feed from the titanic Verizon- and SAP-branded screens hung around the stadium, and the sounds are all echoing off multiple surfaces so that a typical Denver possession sounds like:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">[<em>guitar</em>]eyton[<em>guitar</em>]PeytonanningManning[<em>guitar</em>] M&amp;MsompletecompletetoelkerWelker[<em>guitar</em>]M&amp;Ms</p>
<p>The Seahawks score a safety 12 seconds into the game, the astestfastest, we&#8217;re told, that a team has ever oredscored in an uperSuperowlBowl. The game is just gruesome for the Broncos; it&#8217;s like watching someone asphyxiate themselves via a series of 2.6-yard passes to Demaryius Thomas. Seattle has that starving-locusts-leveling-the-Carolinas quality you sometimes see in an elite NFL defense; it&#8217;s harrowing. I love this Seattle team, but after weeks of buildup and weeks of fake debate about Peyton Manning&#8217;s legacy and weeks of BEST OFFENSE VS. BEST DEFENSE hype, the effect of the beatdown&#8217;s one-sidedness is kind of weird and sad. It&#8217;s actually embarrassing when Denver has the ball. You feel it in your stomach a little. It&#8217;s like watching your dad&#8217;s boss chew out your dad. Only the thing about the Super Bowl stadium experience is that you do not have six uninterrupted seconds to formulate your own feelings or a separate perspective thereon, because the Super Bowl stadium experience is relentlessly organized to remind you — &#8220;inform&#8221; might be a better word — that you&#8217;re having fun. Oh, the fun you&#8217;re having at the Super Bowl. The music blares and the screens flash spinning brand names and the announcers come on to tell you how to operate the battery-powered glitter-hat you&#8217;re going to wear as part of the interactive halftime show that will make <i>you</i> part of the action. Just pull the tab, and the fun will be unforgettable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>In the men&#8217;s room at halftime, I wind up at a urinal between two drunk guys, strangers up till now, who are having the following, largely screamed, conversation.</p>
<p><b>DRUNK PISSING GUY NO. 1:</b> Seahawks!</p>
<p><b>DRUNK PISSING GUY NO. 2:</b> It&#8217;s over.</p>
<p><b>DRUNK PISSING GUY NO. 1:</b> It&#8217;s almost over!</p>

<p><b>DRUNK PISSING GUY NO. 2:</b> Two&#8217;s better than one, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an obvious problem here with the way football mediates your perception of football; participating in the modern stadium experience isn&#8217;t about seeing a thing and responding in your own way so much as it&#8217;s about undergoing the predetermined sequence of feelings dictated by the game&#8217;s organizers. But there&#8217;s also a less obvious problem, which is that you have virtually no ground from which to resist this state of things that is not, itself, already hopelessly mediated and predetermined. My finding the Broncos&#8217; collapse to be &#8220;weird and sad&#8221; depends mostly on my years of built-up acquaintance with the Peyton Manning narrative and my preconceived idea of the expectation and pressure he&#8217;s faced and of the likely emotional ramifications of the legacy debate. Unless you&#8217;ve just hatched from the sky, it&#8217;s pretty much impossible not to be thinking of his position in history vs. his brother&#8217;s position, etc., and more important, it&#8217;s pretty much impossible not to imagine in advance <i>what people will say</i> about these topics. Even if you think it&#8217;s a stupid story, you&#8217;re stuck writing it so you can reject it.</p>
<p>And at the same time, the critique of the Super Bowl as a commodified postmodern spectacle has been made so many times and with so little effect that it&#8217;s become part of Super Bowl week&#8217;s essential tool kit of clichés; announcers refer to it, and may even share many of its convictions. (Who <i>doesn&#8217;t</i> think the game has gotten too corporate, that it could use more atmosphere?) Making the same critique again, once it&#8217;s been absorbed into the thing it set out to criticize, is just another noise in the same postmodern echo chamber. You can mark the first moment of alienation, but try to mark the second and you&#8217;re just alluding to brands. Not even different brands. All you have to do is say the word Doritos. You&#8217;re oingdoing [<em>guitar</em>] their orkwork for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>The Seahawks won, obviously. Confetti sprayed everywhere and an elite team of stadium workers in orange stadium parkas poured out onto the field and built a silver space pod. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and ex-RB great Marcus Allen climbed into the space pod and presented the Lombardi Trophy to Seahawks owner Paul Allen. A voice came over the PA to tell us there were too many people on the train platforms and fans planning to take the train should stay in the stadium until further notice. Till they could get the rocket engine added to the space pod, I guess.</p>
<p>I rode the media bus back to Manhattan. All along Times Square, groups of fans wearing Seahawks jerseys were yelling &#8220;Seahawks!&#8221; as they passed each other, like steamships blowing their horns. Fashion models a hundred feet high twirled on the overhead screens. What does it mean to witness a thing without being able to see it? I walked back to my hotel, waiting for 10 Unforgettable Photos That Captured Super Bowl XLVIII to load on my phone&#8217;s LTE connection.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n Super Bowl Sunday, the NFL&#8217;s Most Valuable Player was no match for the league&#8217;s most valuable contract. Russell Wilson outplayed Peyton Manning in the biggest game of Wilson&#8217;s career, and once that was taken care of, the rest of the Denver roster couldn&#8217;t stack up. For 60 stunning, dominant minutes on Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks were the human manifestation of every tough football cliché you&#8217;ve ever heard an old coach spout. They didn&#8217;t just prevail over the Denver Broncos. In typical Seahawks fashion, they beat Denver up. They exerted their will upon the Broncos in each and every facet of the game. They took control of the game from literally the opening snap from scrimmage<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-48"><sup id="ss-48">48</sup></a> and never let go. And during those few times that they bent, the Seahawks didn&#8217;t break; they snapped back ferociously, extinguishing Denver&#8217;s hopes as soon as the Broncos mustered up the confidence to have any.</p>
<p>More than any other, one old talking point rung true. Football is a war of attrition, and by the time these two teams had reached the sport&#8217;s biggest stage, the Seahawks had won that war. The depth of their relatively healthy roster came through on Sunday, as they exploited overmatched Denver backups stretched into starting roles, while late-round draftees and backups came up with key contributions on both sides of the ball. When Seattle&#8217;s dominant pass defense neutralized Manning, the Broncos simply didn&#8217;t have a team capable of stepping up and rising to the occasion. Instead, when its star was shook, Denver got stomped.</p>
<h2>Possession</h2>
<p>Denver&#8217;s defense had a game it will try in vain to forget. After putting up impressive performances against the Chargers and Patriots to help push the Broncos into Super Bowl XLVIII, the Broncos offered precious little resistance against Russell Wilson &amp; Co. on Sunday. The final score will judge them harshly — 16 of Seattle&#8217;s 43 points came from defensive and special teams scores — but they repeatedly couldn&#8217;t get off the field. The Broncos allowed Seattle to score on six of its first seven meaningful drives,<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-49"><sup id="ss-49">49</sup></a> and by the time they had forced their second stop of the game, there was less than 10 minutes to go in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The Broncos were missing four key defensive contributors because of injuries, and their absence was noted in the disappointing play from their replacements. Backup pass-rusher Robert Ayers, a failed first-round pick from the Josh McDaniels era, was forced into a bigger role by the absence of lineman Derek Wolfe, and he had a dismal first half. Ayers repeatedly lost contain and failed to set the edge on his side of the line, allowing Percy Harvin to gain 45 yards on a pair of jet sweeps, while Wilson repeatedly found space to maneuver when scrambling back to his left, creating throwing lanes and successful runs. Cornerback Tony Carter, a journeyman and special-teamer filling in for the injured Chris Harris, committed a crucial pass interference penalty in the end zone to set up one touchdown before setting up another by missing a tackle. While a fifth key contributor was on the field, he was missing, too: Champ Bailey was a shell of his former self, as the Seahawks were able to beat him for a number of first downs early before the Broncos gave him more help. And a team without star linebacker Von Miller not only failed to sack Wilson, the league&#8217;s most-sacked starter (on a per-attempt basis), it failed to knock him down on even one of his 27 dropbacks.</p>
<p>Should we really have expected a lot out of the Denver defense, though, given the personnel who are actually suiting up these days? This was a team that, even in healthier times, finished the year <a href="http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef" target="_blank">15th in DVOA</a>. When you look at those who were actually seeing serious reps for the Broncos on Sunday, there are just not many players with much of a pedigree. Denver&#8217;s defense is basically split up into bargain-basement veteran reclamation projects signed to short-term deals from free agency (Mike Adams, Terrance Knighton, Paris Lenon, Shaun Phillips, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie), Day 3 draft picks (Omar Bolden, Malik Jackson, Danny Trevathan), and undrafted free agents (Carter, Duke Ihenacho, Mitch Unrein, Wesley Woodyard). The only defensive contributors for Denver on Sunday who weren&#8217;t acquired on the cheap were Ayers, Bailey, 2011 third-rounder Nate Irving, and 2013 first-rounder Sylvester Williams.</p>
<p>John Fox and Jack Del Rio have done an admirable job of coaching their guys up during the year, and they did an excellent job of shutting down Marshawn Lynch by winning at the line of scrimmage. Against a deep, healthy Seahawks passing attack, their lack of depth and, honestly, lack of talent were highlighted. While the Seahawks mostly avoided Rodgers-Cromartie, Wilson was often able to hit receivers up the seam or on quick slants for easy gains, with the Broncos defenders unable to get in his throwing lanes and too slow to seriously contest his passes. When Wilson&#8217;s initial throw wasn&#8217;t there or he felt the beginnings of pressure, he was able to scramble, reset himself, and find a receiver. It wasn&#8217;t his sharpest game, especially at first, but the Broncos offered staggeringly little resistance to the Seattle passing attack. Wilson finished 18-of-25 for 206 yards, and those seven incompletions included five plays when Wilson either overthrew an open receiver or had that open receiver drop a pass. Denver really broke up only two passes all night: the flea flicker that saw Wilson shovel a pass forward out of desperation, and a first-quarter pass up the seam in the end zone that was broken up by Irving.</p>
<p>With Golden Tate kept quiet by DRC, Harvin mostly used as a decoy, and Sidney Rice on the shelf as Seattle&#8217;s lone prominent injury heading into the game, Wilson&#8217;s two most prominent receivers were the &#8220;pedestrian&#8221; duo of Doug Baldwin and Jermaine Kearse, a pair of undrafted free agents whose combined signing bonuses upon joining the league amounted to $26,000.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-50"><sup id="ss-50">50</sup></a> They combined to go 9-of-10 for 131 yards and two touchdowns, with the only incompletion the aforementioned breakup in the end zone. After getting beaten early when they pressed their corners to the line of scrimmage, the Broncos seemed to retreat and play softer, more conservative coverage, allowing Baldwin and Kearse to get off the line of scrimmage and find holes in Denver&#8217;s zones. And when the Broncos decided to try to emulate their big brothers on the other sideline by attempting to knock people down with shoulder tackles, Baldwin and Kearse were able to shrug off sloppy takedown attempts for yards after catch, including the crucial final yards on each of their touchdown catches. With Tate <a href="http://grantland.com/features/super-bowl-swan-song/" target="_blank">a free agent</a> and Rice a possible cap casualty, Baldwin and Kearse are likely to move into more prominent roles next season. After Sunday, pedestrian seems like a speed that might suit Seattle just fine.</p>
<p>As for Harvin, meanwhile, he finally suited up for his first complete game in a Seahawks uniform and might have justified the $14.5 million he collected this season while doing so. While he had only a lone catch for five yards, Harvin was electric on a pair of jet sweeps, one of the many ways in which the Seahawks will employ Harvin&#8217;s unique skill set in 2014 and beyond. More notably, Harvin probably ended the game as a contest when he opened up the third quarter by taking the opening kickoff to the house. It played off the pregame fears about Denver&#8217;s <a href="http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamst" target="_blank">terrible kickoff coverage</a> and Matt Prater&#8217;s kickoffs outside of the thin air at home. In Denver, Prater would have been able to just boot the ball through the back of the end zone on virtually every kickoff, neutralizing Harvin without ever allowing him to touch the ball. Here, with Denver&#8217;s first kickoff of the game coming at the beginning of the second half, Prater tried a popup kick that landed 10 yards short of the end zone, and when Harvin fielded the kick cleanly, the dismal Denver kickoff coverage unit offered little resistance. It seemed like a rare misstep for Seahawks general manager John Schneider when he traded a first-, third-, and seventh-round pick for Harvin this offseason and gave him a $64 million contract extension before Harvin missed virtually the first year of that deal with a hip injury, but as he watched Harvin sprint toward the end zone to put the Seahawks up four scores, I doubt Schneider regretted the trade very much at all.</p>
<h2>Opportunity</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why Schneider was able to take a calculated risk on bringing in Harvin, of course, was Wilson, the most valuable contract in football. Wilson plays football&#8217;s most important position at an extremely high level, but because he was a third-round pick in a league that slots rookie contracts at a given price, his contract ensures that he&#8217;ll be a bargain for years to come. Wilson just finished the second year of a four-year, $3 million contract that counted for just $681,085 against Seattle&#8217;s cap this year. After starting his career 24-8 and winning a Super Bowl in just his second year at the helm, Wilson&#8217;s about to receive a hefty raise to &#8230; $817,302.</p>
<p>His opposite number on Sunday is in the middle of a five-year, $96 million deal that will cost Denver $17.5 million this year and next; Manning will make more per game than Wilson will make all year. The Broncos obviously weren&#8217;t wrong to sign Manning, but they had no choice but to pay him this much, given the competition surrounding him on the free market as an unrestricted free agent two years ago. Even beyond that large sum of money, the Broncos are paying for Manning&#8217;s deal in another way: In a league where every competitive team is trying to spend up to a hard cap, they&#8217;re incurring the opportunity cost of not being able to use that $17.5 million cap hold on anybody else.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what <a href="http://grantland.com/features/bill-barnwell-vanishing-value-veteran-quarterback/" target="_blank">makes Wilson so valuable</a>. In a vacuum,<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-51"><sup id="ss-51">51</sup></a> Wilson is a bargain, but his contract looks even better when you consider that the typical quarterback of his caliber takes up something like $17.5 million of his team&#8217;s salary cap. The Seahawks can take the $16.8 million difference and go spend it elsewhere, which changes the value proposition. Manning is probably a better quarterback than Wilson, but is Wilson plus $16.8 million worth of players better than Manning?</p>
<p>On Sunday, he very much was. The Seahawks made three big free-agent signings this offseason, and they each contributed to the win. Harvin ($4.9 million cap hold this year) had the kickoff return for a touchdown, while Michael Bennett ($4.8 million) and Cliff Avril ($3.8 million) were part of a pass rush that battered Manning all day. After Manning had gone all postseason without being sacked or even knocked down, the Seahawks&#8217; pass rush responded with a dominant performance: It sacked Manning once, knocked him down four times, pressured him on what must have been at least a dozen dropbacks, forced him to fumble, and tipped two of his passes at the line. One of those tipped passes topped a first-half drive on downs deep in Seattle territory. An Avril pressure saw him go through dreadful Denver right tackle Orlando Franklin and drive him back into Manning, resulting in an up-for-grabs throw that game MVP Malcolm Smith returned for a pick-six.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-52"><sup id="ss-52">52</sup></a></p>
<p>Both Franklin and left tackle Chris Clark, filling in for All-Pro Ryan Clady since September, were unable to hold up against Seattle&#8217;s stream of pass-rushers on the outside. Bennett &amp; Co. did enough on the interior to help collapse Manning&#8217;s pocket, forcing him to scramble and/or rush throws. And while there were concerns about a smaller Seattle front failing to hold up when Manning inevitably audibled to run calls, it managed to hold Denver to just 27 yards on 14 carries, problems unquestionably exacerbated by second-half injuries to Knowshon Moreno (who also fumbled) and guard Louis Vasquez. And center Manny Ramirez, a converted guard and the team&#8217;s third choice at that spot after expected starters J.D. Walton and Dan Koppen got hurt in the preseason, dealt with a center&#8217;s worst nightmare when he prematurely snapped the ball on the game&#8217;s opening play from scrimmage for a safety.</p>
<h2>Secondary Modern</h2>
<p>Even when Manning had time to throw, the Seahawks gave him precious little to work with. Before the game, while I noted that <a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-nfl-honor-roll/" target="_blank">Denver had produced the most impressive output in league history</a>, I also wondered <a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-official-super-bowl-preview/" target="_blank">whether Seattle would present a more difficult matchup for them</a> than even their own excellent numbers might suggest. That certainly turned out to be the case.</p>
<p>Seattle didn&#8217;t stay in <a href="http://grantland.com/features/whos-laughing-now/" target="_blank">its traditional Cover 3</a> as much as I might have expected, especially during the first half, when it spent a fair amount of time in one-deep and two-deep zones with man-to-man on Denver&#8217;s outside receivers. With each coverage shell, the concept was the same: prevent the Broncos from completing anything downfield, disrupt their timing, force them into underneath passes and checkdowns, and prevent them from compiling yards after catch. The Broncos are a team built on gaining yards after catch and big plays, and Seattle denied them both.</p>
<p>To be honest, Denver mostly did stuff that you could have read about on Grantland last week before the game (or seen on tape from games past). Denver repeatedly went back to the shallow cross series that Chris Brown diagrammed <a href="http://grantland.com/features/peyton-manning-denver-broncos-offense/" target="_blank">in his article on the Denver offense</a>. It ran a lot of Trips sets designed to force the Seahawks to shift, declare, or change their coverages, but those mostly just produced screens and short catches that didn&#8217;t go anywhere. There were a few times when the Broncos threw a quick screen on a play where they had a man advantage on one side of the field, but the Seahawks were quick to swarm to limit the play to a small gain. Denver also made the mistake of running too many slow-developing screens; while they hoped to use those screens to lure an aggressive Seattle pass rush into overpursuing, the Seahawks defense was so fast and the screens were so slow that the backside pursuit would catch up with the receiver by the time he turned upfield.</p>
<p>The Broncos sacrificed Eric Decker to the Sherman Isle, with Decker catching just one pass on five targets for six yards, even though Sherman suffered a high ankle sprain in the first half and had to be carted off after re-aggravating the injury in the fourth quarter. That left Demaryius Thomas one-on-one versus Byron Maxwell, and while Thomas ended up setting a single-game Super Bowl receptions record with some second-half filler, Denver simply couldn&#8217;t do anything downfield; Manning threw 10 &#8220;deep&#8221; passes,<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-53"><sup id="ss-53">53</sup></a> and on those throws, he went 2-for-10 for 42 yards with an interception, a fumble (by Thomas after a completion), and a 20-yard defensive pass interference penalty. By throwing so many short passes over the middle of the field, the Broncos instead incurred the wrath of Kam Chancellor, who was Seattle&#8217;s most active defender from the beginning of the game onward. He finished with 10 tackles, two passes defensed, and an interception, with six of his tackles coming on passes short of the first-down marker.</p>
<h2>The Impostor</h2>
<p>While Manning eventually racked up empty completions by throwing in a desperate attempt to catch up during the second half, his first-half line is probably more indicative of the kind of day he had: 17-of-23 for 104 yards and two interceptions tells the whole story. The Broncos were able to complete plenty of passes, but they were the throws the Seahawks wanted them to make, all drags and screens. Seattle was confident it would get pressure on Manning and force him or one of his teammates into a mistake before they dinked and dunked their way into the end zone, and it was right. After failing to pick up a first down during three first-quarter drives, Denver&#8217;s six subsequent possessions all ended in Seattle territory. Those six drives produced 18 first downs but managed to score only eight points, thanks to two turnovers, two failed fourth-down conversions, and a truly perplexing punt. I wondered before the game if Denver would be able to beat Seattle in the compressed space of the red zone, but the Seahawks were able to successfully treat the entire field like it was just a series of red zones.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s play America&#8217;s worst game show: What does this loss do for Peyton Manning&#8217;s legacy? The answer, excitingly, is just about nothing! It&#8217;s only going to further entrench either side&#8217;s beliefs. If you think that Manning is the greatest quarterback who ever lived, you probably are going to point to that fifth MVP trophy he picked up this weekend and note that he got virtually no help from the players around him, a common complaint in Manning losses going back to the early Manning-Brady playoff games. And if you think Manning can&#8217;t win in the clutch and needs a better postseason record to justify that title, well, you just got another loss in a big game to add to Peyton&#8217;s loss column, and a 35-point loss at that.</p>
<p>The truth, as uninteresting and irrelevant to this argument as always, is somewhere in the middle. I can&#8217;t really fault Manning for taking what the defense gave him here, and I think the first interception was such because it was tipped at the line, but he should never have thrown the second pick with such pressure in his face, even if it meant taking a sack. His arm strength isn&#8217;t particularly an issue in cold weather, and it was a relatively balmy high 40s in North Jersey last night after all that sanctimony, but his arm strength is definitely subpar on deeper routes, and the Broncos desperately needed at least the threat of an accurate deep throw to put a scare into Seattle&#8217;s cornerbacks. His defense had a bad night, but with eight points to his name, it wasn&#8217;t a banner game for Manning and his offense, either. And it&#8217;s unfair to forget about the two excellent performances he put together against the Chargers and Patriots just because he lost in the Super Bowl, but those were two big games against bad defenses to which he adds a mediocre performance against a great one.</p>
<p>And finally, I guess, there&#8217;s the important distinction to be made between what Manning has done and what Manning is. If you find Manning&#8217;s playoff record lacking, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s unreasonable. If you suggest that it&#8217;s due to some sort of fatal flaw with Manning or something that&#8217;s likely to keep occurring because it&#8217;s happened in the past, it seems instructive to point out the case of Manning&#8217;s boss. John Elway, of course, lost his first three Super Bowls in ignominious fashion: 39-20, 42-10, and, in the biggest Super Bowl blowout ever, 55-10 to the 49ers. Eight years later, he came back and won two Super Bowls in a row, not coincidentally with a dominant rushing offense that he lacked during those first three games. Even the great ones need help, and on Sunday, while he didn&#8217;t play up to his usual standards, Manning&#8217;s team didn&#8217;t offer him much assistance, either.</p>
<h2>Thank You for Not Coaching</h2>
<p>As it turns out, in-game decision-making doesn&#8217;t mean a whole lot in a 43-8 blowout. I could credit Pete Carroll with the aggressive coaching decision of showing up for the game on time and knock John Fox for not convincing the Seahawks to bring in Tarvaris Jackson any earlier, but that wouldn&#8217;t fly. So while these moves didn&#8217;t end up materially affecting the outcome of the game, in most cases, nobody knew that would end up being the case at the time.</p>
<p>Do you like awful challenges? If so, man, was the first quarter of this game for you. The Seahawks got the ball rolling early when Carroll threw out the challenge flag on their opening drive, when a Wilson scramble was ruled to have come up a yard short on third down. It&#8217;s certainly a high-reward challenge, since a successful overturn would have turned fourth-and-short into first-and-goal from the 9-yard line, but there hadn&#8217;t been any replays that suggested Wilson had clearly picked up the first down. It was a challenge driven by sheer optimism and hope, which actually is just about the perfect motivation for a Pete Carroll challenge flag.</p>
<p>Review found that the ball should be placed closer to the marker, turning fourth-and-1 into fourth-and-a-foot, but the challenge needs to produce a first down to be considered a victory and allow Carroll to keep his timeout and possibility of a third challenge.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-54"><sup id="ss-54">54</sup></a> Carroll then compounded his mistake by kicking a field goal on that fourth-and-a-foot as opposed to going for it. You could argue that he knows his team — the Seahawks were the <a href="http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol" target="_blank">worst team in football in power situations this year</a> — but it&#8217;s a foot. If you can successfully field the snap, you can pick up a foot.</p>
<p>Not to be topped, Fox unsurprisingly pulled out his challenge flag in an even worse spot. I still haven&#8217;t run the TYFNC Awards, but Fox will likely win worst challenge of the year for <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/thank-you-for-not-coaching-week-6/" target="_blank">an early challenge against the Jaguars in Week 6</a>. I wrote then that Fox “just doesn&#8217;t understand what the challenge flag is good for, and that might end up costing his team in a spot when the challenges really do matter.&#8221; And hey, here we are! He threw the flag out in a similarly desperate moment, hoping that an incomplete screen pass to Harvin was a lateral, despite replays that rather clearly indicated that the pass had moved forward in the air. You can&#8217;t fault Fox for trying to generate a turnover when his team was reeling, and to be fair, this one is most likely on whomever was watching the replays upstairs and told Fox that the replays were unclear. If that person told Fox it was clearly a fumble, they should hire a new person. And if it was a judgment call, Fox should have held on to the flag.</p>
<p>In the end, that decision actually did end up hurting the Broncos. When they failed on fourth-and-2 from the Seattle 19-yard line with 1:06 left in the first half, they gave the ball back to Seattle, which ran two draws (sigh) to end the first half. Had Fox not thrown his flag on the pass to Harvin, he would have had all three timeouts after the failed fourth-down conversion, which would have allowed Denver to get the ball back with something like 50 seconds left after a stop. Instead, Fox just let the clock run out.</p>
<p>That fourth-and-2 decision was the right call. The numbers suggest that the Broncos <a href="http://wp.advancednflstats.com/4thdncalc1.php" target="_blank">would generate 2.4 points by going for it and 2.0 points by kicking the field goal</a>. Seattle had been successful against the Denver offense all night, but if there was one thing the Broncos offense had done well, it was pick up short gains in the passing game. There is also the emotional aspect; for whatever dumb momentum argument exists about a team somehow taking hold of a game by kicking a field goal down 22-0 with a minute left before halftime, what does it tell your team with the greatest offense since sliced bread if you don&#8217;t think it can get two yards? If you can&#8217;t pick up two yards in that spot, how are you going to come back from a three-touchdown deficit?</p>
<p>Later, the Broncos punted under even more curious circumstances. Down 29-0 in the third quarter with a third-and-10 on the Seattle 38-yard line, the Broncos oddly chose to hand the ball off to Montee Ball on a draw, which went for a loss of one. Denver then took the greatest offense in NFL history off the field so it could punt while down four touchdowns inside its opponent&#8217;s 40-yard line.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-55"><sup id="ss-55">55</sup></a> Insane, right?</p>
<p>Well, not necessarily. The <i>New York Times</i> fourth-down bot, which is built with the data from Brian Burke&#8217;s <a href="//www.advancednflstats.com" target="_blank">Advanced NFL Stats</a> site, suggested that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/11/28/fourth-downs/play.html?gameid=02022014_SEA@DEN&amp;playid=231827" target="_blank">punting was the slightly more positive move</a>, improving Denver&#8217;s chances of winning from 6 percent to 7 percent. But given that Denver is very clearly an offense-driven team, that&#8217;s probably enough to swing the percentages toward going for it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I just think the Broncos panicked. Whether it was a call from the sideline by offensive coordinator Adam Gase or a decision at the line by Manning, my suspicion is that the third-down draw was designed to set up a more manageable fourth-down play (or a more manageable long field goal, but let&#8217;s hope that wasn&#8217;t the case). When Denver got stuffed, it was totally stuck in no-man&#8217;s-land, didn&#8217;t know what to do, and just punted. Given how good Seattle&#8217;s defense looked at times during the Super Bowl, that might have been a pretty good option for Denver on first down, let alone fourth.</p>

<p><b>Q: My buddy and I came up with a great idea for a stoner flick called &#8220;Archie Manning&#8217;s Vasectomy.&#8221; Two Boston burnouts somehow find a time machine and go back in time to New Orleans circa 1973. They try to convince Archie Manning that he and the Saints will win the Super Bowl if he has a vasectomy. It&#8217;s <i>The Terminator</i> meets <i>Bill &amp; Ted</i> meets <i>Half Baked</i>. What do you think?</b><br />
<b>—Gabe Perez, Los Angeles</b></p>
<p>SG: I think you just created something that could potentially leapfrog <i>The Verdict, The Town</i> and <i>The Departed</i> as the most popular Boston movie ever. My biggest note: Definitely name the lead characters &#8220;Murph and Sully.&#8221; And I&#8217;d seriously consider throwing them into the title &#8212; something like <em>Murph and Sully Stop the Mannings</em>, just to avoid the inevitable lawsuit when Archie hires an army of lawyers to stop production of <em>Archie Manning&#8217;s Vasectomy.</em> You want to make sure this movie gets made. Even if you&#8217;re losing a better title, take consolation in <em>Archie Manning&#8217;s Vasectomy</em> becoming the most popular name for a fantasy football team. Which should probably happen anyway.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can we give Marshawn Lynch the Dan Dierdorf award for most negatives in a sentence? <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/28/marshawn-lynchs-super-bowl-media-day-i-aint-never-seen-no-talking-winning-nothing" target="_blank">He told Deion Sanders</a>, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t never seen no talking winning nothing!&#8221; That quadruple negative has Dierdorf wanting to broadcast another season or two.</b><br />
<b>—Joe Davis, Baltimore</b></p>
<p>SG: Did anyone think Marshawn Lynch would defeat Richard Sherman as the MVP of Super Bowl week so far? As late as Monday night, Lynch had to be a +800 underdog, right? Then he stole attention on media day with his pseudo-talking boycott, then successfully repeated the saying-just-enough-not-to-get-fined strategy on Wednesday. <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/10363225/super-bowl-marshawn-lynch-seattle-seahawks-agrees-deal-skittles" target="_blank">He announced a Skittles deal</a> and a new Skittles flavor (&#8220;Seattle Mix&#8221;). He <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/28/marshawn-lynch-keeps-low-profile-at-media-day-drops-s-bomb-on-nfln/" target="_blank">said the word &#8220;shit&#8221; on NFL Network</a>. Another one of his media day quotes (&#8220;Just ’bout that action, boss&#8221;) was quickly turned into a DJ Steve Porter–type remix song <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1941485-marshawn-lynchs-bout-that-action-clip-gets-remixed" target="_blank">that&#8217;s actually pretty decent</a>. His <a href="http://blogs.seattletimes.com/seahawks/2014/01/21/marshawn-lynch-interviewed-by-nfl-japan/" target="_blank">incredible candy interview with Japan</a> from a while back continued to make the Internet rounds. And he unleashed the first recorded quadruple negative in sports interview history. I&#8217;m not so sure that Dan Dierdorf can&#8217;t believe what just happened!</p>
<p><b>Q: Is Aqib Talib hobbling off the field your least favorite AFC Championship Game tradition?<br />
—Kyle, Philly</b></p>
<p>SG: It&#8217;s right up there with the annual Sunday-night post-Pats elimination conversation with my dad &#8212; you know, the one in which we try to figure out why Belichick won&#8217;t get Brady more weapons, why the Pats can&#8217;t score more than 17 points in any playoff exit game even though they always average 30-plus during the season, and who&#8217;s going to fold first and point out that Brady has unquestionably played poorly in five of these playoff losses (Denver twice, Baltimore twice, Jets) and missed big throws in all those games, followed by us both profusely apologizing to one another for ever daring to criticize Brady.</p>
<p><b>Q: I can take solace in this one fact post-AFC Championship game: At least we know the Patriots aren&#8217;t using steroids.</b><br />
<b>—Mike, Boston</b></p>
<p>SG: (Nodding sadly.)</p>
<p><b>Q: If anyone can bring back the nickname for Richard as &#8220;Dick,&#8221; it is Richard Sherman. In fact, for Super Bowl week, why isn&#8217;t he insisting that everyone refer to him as &#8220;Dick Sherman?&#8221;</b><br />
<b>—Chris G, Burbank</b></p>
<p>SG: That&#8217;s baloney &#8212; after Dick LeBeau and Mighty Mighty Bosstones singer Dicky Barrett did a phenomenal job of carrying the &#8220;Dick&#8221; banner in the 1990s, we watched Dick Cheney mortally wound the Dick franchise last decade, then saw <a href="https://twitter.com/Dickc" target="_blank">Twitter CEO Dick Costolo</a> valiantly save it once Twitter took off in 2009. There&#8217;s even a Twitter account for <a href="https://twitter.com/Dick" target="_blank">fake Dick Costolo tweets</a> called &#8220;Fake Dick.&#8221; If you&#8217;re the impetus for &#8220;Fake Dick,&#8221; then you brought back &#8220;Dick.&#8221; But that doesn&#8217;t mean Sherman can&#8217;t make the shift to &#8220;Dick Sherman.&#8221; Who knows, maybe he could even pave the way for Dick Incognito, Dick Simmons, Dickie Sambora, Dick Gannon, Dicky Deitsch, Dick Grieco …</p>
<p><b>Q: Every time Richard Sherman gets an interception my friends and I call it a &#8220;Dick Pick&#8221;. It could be the greatest inappropriate way to describe an interception of all-time. Why can&#8217;t the media say this? This should be a thing. Life is unfair sometimes.</b><br />
<b>—Pete, Seattle</b></p>
<p>SG: Hold on, I&#8217;m trying to figure out if I count as media.</p>
<p>(Checking.)</p>
<p>Good news &#8212; apparently I count! Thanks for coming up with my ideal ending for SB XLVIII, Pete. Imagine if Peyton Manning lost Super Bowls in 2010 and 2014 thanks to a TAINT<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-56"><sup id="ss-56">56</sup></a> and a Dick Pick, respectively.</p>
<p><b>Q: Remember the time Roger Clemens threw a bat at Mike Piazza like an out-of-control freaking lunatic and we were all like &#8220;He&#8217;s pretty pumped up in the heat of the moment, yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk,&#8221; and then in retrospect we were all like &#8220;Whoa, he was obviously REALLY on steroids or PEDs or something&#8221; and &#8220;how did that not occur to us at the time?&#8221; Cue montage of every single Richard Sherman clip and/or reaction from Championship weekend &#8230; aaaaaaand roll tape!</b><br />
<b>—David Chernicoff, Oakland</b></p>
<p>SG: Allow me to swerve the other way &#8212; I&#8217;m defending someone from a team that&#8217;s running away with the <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/jerrybrewer/2022341301_brewer27xml.html" target="_blank">&#8220;most PED/drug suspensions since 2010” record</a>, and who even got suspended himself in 2011 before <a href="http://tracking.si.com/2012/12/27/richard-sherman-suspension-drug-test-sue-seahawks-nfl/" target="_blank">getting the result overturned</a> with the rarely seen &#8220;urine sample taken in a leaky cup by someone with a history of errors&#8221; defense (otherwise known as the Ryan Braun<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-57"><sup id="ss-57">57</sup></a>) and then answered &#8220;<a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9364711/richard-sherman-seems-seattle-seahawks-ped-problem" target="_blank">It seems like we do</a>&#8221; last summer when asked if Seattle had a problem with PEDs. Sherman had just finished playing tackle football against someone he disliked for three solid hours. That person had disrespected him on Twitter, which is the third-worst thing one athlete can do to another in 2014, trailing only sleeping with his girlfriend/wife and running him over with a Hummer. On top of that, the opposing team had disrespected Sherman by challenging him late on the biggest drive of the game &#8212; with a 25-yard fade pattern, no less &#8212; which he foiled (on a play that sent Seattle to the Super Bowl). And he was fired up about heading to the Super Bowl, obviously. So he gets yanked off the field and interviewed <em>immediately</em> after the game. And he&#8217;s a passionate guy, anyway.</p>
<p>My question: Let&#8217;s say I presented that scenario to you right before the game, then said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s bet … if a charged-up Richard Sherman doesn&#8217;t say anything that outrages America in this interview, I will give you $500. But if he DOES say something that outrages America, you have to give me $200.&#8221; Would you have taken that bet? No way. You would have tried to negotiate a 1,200/200 ratio. So I don&#8217;t get the Clemens/Piazza parallels at all. It can&#8217;t be forgotten how insane/illogical/perplexing that Clemens moment was: Piazza&#8217;s bat breaks, then Clemens mistakenly fields one of the bat&#8217;s pieces like it&#8217;s a baseball, whips it at a jogging Piazza and starts F-bombing him. That was like a deleted scene from <em>Pain &amp; Gain.</em> And it took us an extra eight years to realize it.</p>
<p><b>Q: Apparently some of the survival traits you learn by growing up in Compton and scrapping to survive are only acceptable for rappers. You worship Pac, Simmons, and I do too, but was Pac a better human than Sherman? Pac bangs a guy&#8217;s wife and calls him out on the national stage and it&#8217;s this epic &#8220;throwing down the gauntlet&#8221; moment, but Sherman destroys the Niners, calls out Crabtree and he&#8217;s classless? F&#8211;k the Niners and f&#8211;k Jim &#8220;A man can be defeated but not destroyed&#8221; the warrior poet Harbaugh.</b><br />
<b>—John Wolff, Missouri</b></p>
<p>SG: God, you were so close to grabbing the lead in the Best Mailbag Email of 2014 race, John Wolff! If only your last sentence had been, &#8220;Well this is how we gonna do this. F&#8212;- Crabtree, f&#8212;- Harbaugh, f&#8212;- the Niners as a team, a franchise and a motherf&#8212;ing crew, and if you wanna be down with the Niners, f&#8212;- you too!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Q: What is it about attending Stanford immediately negates the fact that Richard Sherman is an a-hole? Let&#8217;s all remember this is the same place that Tiger Woods, John McEnroe, Kerri Strug and Manti Teo&#8217;s fake girlfriend all attended. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, some schools like Duke graduate more a-holes than others, but no school should give their graduates a free pass from their future behavior.</b><br />
<b>—Sean McGuire, Gaithersburg, Maryland</b></p>
<p>SG: I just spent the last 15 minutes trying to figure out how Kerri Strug ended up in that email. Even went down a Kerri Strug Google rabbit hole and everything. Unsolved mystery.</p>
<p><b>Q: On December 22, 2013, a special teams defender came streaking in from the right side of the formation, lept, extended his arms, and delivered a glancing blow on the pigskin, stopping it from reaching the goal posts. It was the NFL&#8217;s last blocked extra point. The blocker? Bernard KARMELL Pollard! That&#8217;s right, there&#8217;s a chance that Bernard KARMELL Pollard murdered the Point After Touchdown.</b><br />
<b>—Ryan U, Somerville, Massachusetts</b></p>
<p>SG: Add that to the list. Pollard also concussed Wes Welker in December, then Welker came back for the playoffs and knocked Aqib Talib out of the AFC title game &#8212; it was like Pollard transferred his evil powers to Welker like they were starring in a Wes Craven movie. If Welker takes out any Seahawks in the Super Bowl, we might have to use the <a href="http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-eerily-unexplainable-indiana-demon-house-that-demands-to-be-turned-into-a-movie/" target="_blank">Indiana exorcism specialists</a> on him. As for the death of extra points, kickers missed a total of 18 extra points during the past three regular seasons … and made 3,691 of them. So, every 200 times they miss one? What a waste of time. If the NBA turned all technical foul shots into layup attempts, wouldn&#8217;t people think that was ridiculous?</p>
<p>All right, so how do you fix it? Snapping the ball from the 10 on point-after kicks just sounds goofy. Roger Goodell brought up an intriguing wrinkle: Maybe the NFL makes every touchdown worth seven points, but if you go for two and get it, you climb to eight points (and if you miss it, you drop to six points). I also like the &#8220;every point-after kick has to be a dropkick&#8221; idea, if only because nobody is turning the channel on a dropkick. But what&#8217;s the best idea? I give you Travis T. from Alabama.</p>
<p><b>Q: What do you think of this PAT idea? One of the 11 offensive players on the field at the time of the touchdown has to kick the PAT. So it&#8217;s still worth one point, but it will decrease the difficulty disparity between 1 and 2 points &#8212; thus increasing potential for 2 point conversions and lessening certainty of the PAT kick.</b><br />
<b>—Travis T., Montgomery, Alabama</b></p>
<p>SG: Bammo. Just a phenomenal idea that creates the following wrinkles …</p>
<p>1. Every PAT now becomes a must-watch, especially any game-tying PAT in the fourth quarter. Real tension! Who&#8217;s turning the channel as LeSean McCoy or Tom Brady tries to cap off a game-tying drive by nailing the point after?</p>
<p>2. More two-point conversion attempts if a team decides that the right PAT kicker isn&#8217;t on the field. The phrase &#8220;more two-point conversions&#8221; is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>3. We just created a new way for Tony Romo to lose a nationally televised game.</p>
<p>4. The free-agent value of certain skill position guys, quarterbacks and even offensive linemen would increase if they could bang home 95 percent of those PATs. Couldn&#8217;t you see the Lions overpaying some right guard who also &#8220;kicked in high school and could become a PAT weapon&#8221;?</p>
<p>5. Bill Barnwell&#8217;s inevitable &#8220;Best PAT kickers&#8221; monthly power rankings column. Coming in at no. 1 … Randall Cobb! Who knew???</p>
<p>6. At least one field goal kicker revolting and writing a whiny &#8220;they&#8217;re making a mockery of the game and what I do for a living&#8221; essay for a sports blog (bonus points if he&#8217;s mysteriously waived Kluwe-style a few weeks later).</p>
<p>7. A valuable offensive player (probably a QB, and definitely someone on the Bills, Browns, Vikings or Lions) blowing out his ACL while kicking a PAT, followed by a week of sports debates about how the new PAT rule is moronic … and then, of course, the league panicking and switching back to the old PAT rule.</p>
<p><b>Q: When listing nicknames for SB48, aka the first Stoner State Bowl (hey, there&#8217;s another!), how could you miss &#8220;The Cotton Mouth Bowl&#8221;?</b><br />
<b>—Ray Charbonneau, Arlington, Massachusetts</b></p>
<p>SG: I still love the Doobie Bowl … but man, the Cotton Mouth Bowl is pretty inspired. Can we use both nicknames? If Sean Combs, Triple H and Apollo Creed can have multiple nicknames, then our first Super Bowl between the two states that legalized marijuana should have multiple nicknames. By the way, you guys can stop sending me every conceivable variation of the &#8220;After seeing this Super Bowl matchup, when are Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota legalizing marijuana?&#8221; joke. We&#8217;re at capacity.</p>
<p><b>Q: I heard your podcast with Sal the Cuz when you predicted the Seahawks would be favored by 3 and a half. I thought you were a half point off but agreed with you that Seattle should be favorites. We were both way way off and Seattle is now a field goal dog. You love shoehorning pop culture references into sports conversations more than Bieber loves Sizzurp. What movie scene captures your feelings about jumping on the Seahawks +3 even though the bet looks too easy and you stunk picking games all season? </b><br />
<b>—Brandon, The Metropolis</b></p>
<p>SG: Look, there&#8217;s no way I love shoehorning pop culture references into sports conversations more than the Biebs loves sizzurp. That&#8217;s crazy talk. But you read me well. I love the Seahawks. They played a much tougher schedule. They&#8217;re a better all-around team. They&#8217;re built for cold weather. They have the perfect pass rush–secondary combo to throw at Manning. And even if you look at the difference in January games, Seattle played two wars against elite teams (New Orleans and San Francisco); Denver needed a third-and-17 laser to finish off 9-7 San Diego, and it coasted to an easy win over an overachieving Pats team. Throw in a frosty night in Jersey and I think Seattle should be favored by 3.</p>
<p>Important note to remember: The general public sets every gambling line. Vegas only wants to guarantee itself an equal amount of action on each side. From the moment this line posted, people started banging Denver. And they kept banging Denver. And they kept banging Denver. So you could even say there&#8217;s a little &#8220;Nobody Believes In Us&#8221; potential with the Seahawks. It&#8217;s the perfect gambling situation in every respect: getting points, going against the public, taking the proven cold-weather team, going with defense over offense … it&#8217;s just perfect. And that&#8217;s why the line makes me feel like De Niro imploring Henry Hill&#8217;s wife to <em>pick up some dresses</em> at the end of <em>Goodfellas</em>.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, there&#8217;s your free Seattle money … you&#8217;re definitely gonna win. It&#8217;s right over there. Just around the corner. No no no, it&#8217;s right in there! Where you going?</em></p>

<p><b>Q: Also I bet my friend 20 dollars that this email gets in the mailbag. I studied other mailbags to see what worked and figured it out. I put this email on a platter for you Simmons. </b><br />
<b>—Brandon, The Metropolis</b></p>
<p>SG: So to recap — Brandon ruined my confidence in my Super Bowl pick AND ruined my confidence in my ability to pick mailbag questions. Terrific.</p>
<p><b>Q: During the most recent Cousin Sal podcast (Jan. 21), the AOL &#8220;goodbye&#8221; sound byte can be heard at 12:34. I&#8217;m sure of it since I decided to rewind it 50 times for confirmation. Which one of you is using the computer from the <em>Lost</em> hatch? Does the loser of the &#8216;guess the lines&#8217; contest have to use AOL CD&#8217;s for internet access until next season?</b><br />
<b>—Jesse Majcher, San Francisco</b></p>
<p>SG: That was me. Wait, is this why everyone on Grantland&#8217;s staff starts laughing every time they hear the &#8220;good-bye&#8221; sound, or when I pull out my BlackBerry to type an email? Am I like Unfrozen Caveman Sportswriter?</p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t understand your Gmail and your iPhones.

<p><b>Q: I believe the closest qb to ever become the greatest quarterback of all time (including playoffs) was Tom Brady in 2007, when he set the touchdown record (50), was undefeated until the Super Bowl (18-0), and one win away from achieving four Super Bowls in eight years and breaking the &#8217;72 Dolphins&#8217; record. He also would have had the greatest win percentage ever. Unfortunately, the &#8220;helmet catch&#8221; happened and you know the rest. That&#8217;s how close Brady was to being the greatest quarterback of all time. But I do believe Peyton Manning 2014 will win the Super Bowl, to go along with the td record, and passing yds record, making him the greatest single season quarterback of all time.</b><br />
<b>—Dr. Funk, Halifax</b></p>
<p>SG: This was the last step in a Halifax conversation that clearly started with the question, &#8220;How can we get Simmons to open the window of his New York hotel and jump out of it?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Q: The immense backlash against Richard Sherman can only lead to one possible conclusion: it is all a setup by Roger Goodell to keep other, far more important topics from becoming media talking points! If the ongoing concussions debate and retired players compensation lawsuits get pushed aside, then nobody will push for some true safety reforms that might diminish league revenue if the public thinks the product has &#8220;gone soft.&#8221; So what does he do? He writes a brilliant speech for a player who was already outspoken that comes off as so arrogant and showboating that a whole week of real issues is instantly lost! Your thoughts?</b><br />
<b>—Trey, Boise</b></p>
<p>SG: So you&#8217;re saying that Goodell is stealing from the David Stern playbook? I like it! Maybe that&#8217;s also why he brought up changing point-after kicks — anything he can do to deflect attention away from concussions, lawsuits and PEDs is a big win. I&#8217;m amazed he didn&#8217;t &#8220;throw it out there&#8221; that Los Angeles is being seriously considered as an expansion team, or that they&#8217;re &#8220;considering&#8221; proposals to legalize medicinal marijuana, shorten the goal posts or test an orange glow-in-the-dark football for night games. Stern would have done all these things.</p>
<p>(Since we&#8217;re here, congratulations to Stern for 30 unforgettably great years with the National Basketball Association. So what if those 30 years were from 1976 through 2006 — starting when he facilitated the NBA-ABA merger as a hard-driving league attorney in 1976, took over as deputy commissioner, created the salary cap and came up with a hardcore drug policy even before he actually took office — and not the actual 30 years when he ran the NBA? That 1976-2006 stretch was spectacular. If it&#8217;s OK with you, I am saving my extended thoughts for another time.)</p>
<p><b>Q: I have tried to come up with words. I have tried to come up with sports award analogies (breakthrough performance, etc.). But in the end, I have found that I am neither emotionally prepared nor literally capable of describing the importance of Alexandra Daddario&#8217;s nude scene in the second episode of <em>True Detective</em>. Please, I need your help.</b><br />
<b>—Steve, Atlanta</b></p>
<p>SG: Hands down, it was the most extraordinary nude scene since <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>.</p>
<p><b>Q: I was thinking of titles for the inevitable 30 for 30 in a couple years on the Seahawks after the whole organization gets suspended for a season due to PEDs. This was the best I could come up with: &#8220;The Space Needles&#8221;. Thoughts?</b><br />
<b>—Steve, Nashville</b></p>
<p>SG: I like <em>The Space Needles</em> slightly more than I like <em>Guiltless in Seattle</em> or <em>The Greenie River</em>, but not as much as I like <em>The Real 12th Man</em>.</p>
<p><b>Q: What would the best Super Bowl week trash talking comment be? Can you top Manning saying &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna complete so many passes on Richard Sherman, that he&#8217;ll be the most depressed Seattle resident since Kurt Cobain&#8221;?</b><br />
<b>—Tony Greco, New Orleans</b></p>
<p>SG: There&#8217;s only one way to hurt people from Seattle. Even the email we just ran didn&#8217;t hurt them. If you make fun of their celebs, grunge music, the weather, Paul Allen, Starbucks, Microsoft, the Mariners, pot legalization, their football team&#8217;s PED/drug suspensions … say anything, it will roll right off them. They don&#8217;t care. But if a Bronco like Manning said anything along the lines of, &#8220;On Sunday, I&#8217;m gonna steal this Super Bowl from Seattle like Clay Bennett stole the Sonics!,&#8221; or, &#8220;There are two certainties in life: The Seahawks aren&#8217;t winning the Super Bowl this Sunday, and Seattle is never getting another NBA team,&#8221; or even something more subtle like, &#8220;I look forward to winning the Super Bowl, then celebrating with Clay Bennett, Howard Schultz and Aubrey McClendon,&#8221; that might start our first American civil war in 150 years. The 206 wouldn&#8217;t stand for that. Six months from now, you&#8217;d be watching Brian Williams say on <em>NBC Nightly News</em>, &#8220;The casualties continue to mount in the Civil War of 2014, as Seattle&#8217;s army surged into downtown Denver and inflicted the biggest damage yet … ”</p>
<p><b>Q: No one is talking about Peyton Manning&#8217;s Glove. He knows he can&#8217;t grip the ball well under 40 degrees. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s been using this ENTIRE season to get used to that glove. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s worn in it domes and on 70 degree days. <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/despite-very-good-conditions-peyton-manning-still-wearing-182908219--nfl.html" target="_blank">It was all in preparation for the wintry playoffs</a>. It was all in preparation for THIS GAME. This is what he does, Simmons. He&#8217;s going to win. He figured this all out months ago. BET ON PEYTON. Heed my words.</b><br />
<b>—Robbie, Chicago</b></p>
<p>SG: For me, this game isn&#8217;t about Manning&#8217;s glove and his grip/velocity — it&#8217;s about Seattle&#8217;s ability to keep pressuring/hitting/belting/walloping/nailing Manning and turn him into a beaten-up 37-year-old guy who doesn&#8217;t want to get thrown into the frozen turf anymore. And alongside that, Seattle&#8217;s secondary should crush Denver&#8217;s receivers after the catch, much like Baltimore did to New England&#8217;s skill guys in January 2013. Seattle has to make Manning miserable — that&#8217;s been the recurring theme in just about every Manning playoff loss. <em>Make him miserable, and make his skill guys miserable. Keep belting them.</em> The Seahawks are uniquely equipped to do this. That&#8217;s why I am leaning toward picking them.</p>
<p><b>Q: What are the odds that the Broncos win the Super Bowl, it&#8217;s hovering around 15 degrees when the game ends and they douse Coach Fox in Gatorade where he immediately goes into cardiac arrest? It&#8217;s horrible to think about, but frighteningly practical.</b><br />
<b>—Jeremy, Denver</b></p>
<p>SG: I&#8217;m not running this email for laughs — I&#8217;m running it as a public warning. If the Broncos win, can we all agree that the Broncos shouldn&#8217;t dump a giant bucket of Gatorade on John Fox in frigid weather? Just pour a ceremonial 16-ounce bottle on his right shoulder and be done with it.</p>
<p><b>Q: So I guess that now football is over you&#8217;ll go back to shooting the shit about crappy NBA games on TV and writing a column once every three months. Consider this a preemptive strike: You suck, Simmons! Write a column already!</b><br />

<p><b>Q: I used to believe in you. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/100722/mailbag1" target="_blank">In 2010</a>, you predicted that Justin Bieber would be the one child star &#8220;who wouldn&#8217;t go off the deep end,&#8221; explaining, &#8220;He&#8217;s Canadian. Canadians don&#8217;t go off the deep end. Lock it down.&#8221; How can I trust anything you say anymore?</b><br />
<b>—Jebediah, Fullerton, California</b></p>
<p>SG: Wait, it took my horrible Bieber prediction for you to stop trusting my opinions??? That was the catalyst? It wasn&#8217;t me being 34 games under .500 picking NFL games this season? By the way, <a href="http://grantland.com/features/who-breaks-a-butterfly-upon-a-wheel/" target="_blank">that Bieber prediction was flawed</a> coming out of the gate, given the late Corey Haim was Canadian (and I totally forgot this).</p>
<p><b>Q: It pains me to ask you this, because I consider you an inspiration to me. And to waste your time with Justin Bieber insults your writing and the use of my time. But has Bieber entered the Tyson Zone?</b><br />
<b>—Will Alisberg, New York</b></p>
<p>SG: Terrific question. I like that you managed to insult yourself and me. My quickie answer: OF COURSE! Are you kidding me? Name me a Bieber story that would surprise you right now. Bieber funded a dog-fighting ring? Bieber funded a cock-fighting ring? Bieber visited Aaron Hernandez in jail? Bieber fought Shia LaBeouf to the death … and won? Bieber staggered onto the field during the Super Bowl, covered in sizzurp, and got tackled by four security guards? Bieber hit on Cheryl Bernard in Sochi during the Olympics before getting knocked unconscious by a curling stone? Should I keep going?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one way Bieber can make Tyson Zone history: By dating someone who also happens to be in the Tyson Zone, which would then quadruple their Tyson Zone powers. It&#8217;s happened only one other time that I can remember: when Bobby Brown was married to Whitney Houston, ultimately producing a Tyson Zone daughter who recently announced that she is <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bobbi-kristina-brown-and-nick-gordon-happily-married-see-their-wedding-rings-2014101" target="_blank">married to her adopted brother</a>. Those are the stakes for Biebs. He needs to knock up Miley Cyrus pretty much tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Q: Will you acknowledge in this Friday&#8217;s column that Manning and the Broncos completely dominated and beat the Belichick and Brady Pats fair and square?</b><br />
<b>—Deepak, Texas</b></p>
<p>SG: (Grimly nodding.)</p>
<p><b>Q: I like Richard Sherman. He took it a bit too far with Crabtree and I may not like him as a person, but he makes the league more entertaining. Now we need a receiver who will talk with him. Today&#8217;s elite offensive players say the right things and go about their business. Give me the players, past or present, you&#8217;d most like to see lined up against Richard Sherman on game day. </b><br />
<b>—Curt, Boston</b></p>
<p>SG: 2000 Randy Moss in a landslide — not just for the nonstop woofing and shoving that would eventually cause a double ejection and a frustrated Troy Aikman to sob on live TV, but because the matchup itself (tall, athletic cornerback trying to stop tall, freak-athlete receiver) would have been consistently fascinating. Runner-up choices: 1991 Michael Irvin, 2005 Steve Smith and 2002 Marvin Harrison — wait, scratch Harrison, I don&#8217;t want Sherman to coincidentally get shot by a custom-made and extremely rare Belgian gun.</p>
<p><b>Q: While everybody gushes about how quickly the 49ers have become contenders under Harbaugh, what&#8217;s ignored is that they have also mastered the mysterious art of the Pre-2004 Red Sox of getting thiiiiiiiiis close and then losing in the most painful way possible. First it was Kyle Williams, who needed only to literally do nothing and walk away to avoid a punt to beat the Giants in regular time, then he fumbled another punt in OT. Against Baltimore, they get to the 5 and call the four dumbest plays imaginable to lose. Then against Seattle, they get into the red zone, 35 seconds left, 2 timeouts. And they call a fade. Thrown by a mobile QB who isn&#8217;t a static pocket passer. Into double coverage. Against Richard Sherman. On 1st down.</b><br />
<b>—Drew, Raleigh, North Carolina</b></p>
<p>SG: Glad Drew brought this up. Has another NFL team made the Final Four for three straight years, had a legitimate chance to win all three games late, then lost those games in legitimately agonizing ways? My gut feeling was &#8220;no,&#8221; but we have this thing called &#8220;the Internet&#8221; that allows us to look up useless crap at all hours of the day. Well … <a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/results/championships" target="_blank">since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970</a>, only Philly (2001-04), Buffalo (1990-93), Oakland (1973-75),<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-58"><sup id="ss-58">58</sup></a> Dallas (1980-82) and the Rams (1974-76) played in at least three straight conference title games without winning the Super Bowl. None of those teams lost three straight &#8220;heartbreakers,&#8221; which means the Niners made tortured football history.</p>
<p>And if this current bunch never wins the Super Bowl, they&#8217;d have to be mentioned in every Absolutely Brutal Football Stretch conversation along with the 1973-77 Vikings (three Super Bowl losses, one NFC title loss AND the Staubach-Pearson Pseudo Hail Mary/Push-off loss), the 1986-87 Browns (shaking my head) and the 1990-93 Bills (shaking my head). Important note: The 1968-75 Raiders (two AFL title game losses, four AFC title games losses AND the <a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-immaculate-reception-franco-harris-pittsburgh-steelers-owners-ball-play/" target="_blank">Immaculate Reception loss</a>) and 2006-07 Patriots (blew an 18-point AFC title game lead, then the Helmet Catch Game) are ineligible because they won Super Bowls near those windows, although they have to be mentioned.</p>
<p>You know who Jim Harbaugh has to thank for his 2011-13 Niners teams not getting thrown into the same sentence with Bud Grant&#8217;s Vikes, Marty Schottenheimer&#8217;s Browns and Marv Levy&#8217;s Bills? Peyton Manning and Dick Sherman. Those guys blew away every other story line coming out of championship weekend, right? The poor Niners got a reprieve &#8212; just know that people will be rekindling that angle in August as we&#8217;re closing in on the 2014 season. Start getting emotionally prepared for a never-ending barrage of clips of the Pearson catch, the Drive, the Fumble, Wide Right, Kyle Williams and the Sherman tip, Vikes/Chiefs/Bills/Browns/Niners fans. It&#8217;s coming.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-59"><sup id="ss-59">59</sup></a></p>

<p><b>Q: Why does Russell Wilson suddenly have Greg Gumbel&#8217;s hairdo? This is the strangest hair related decision any athlete has made since Jordan said, &#8220;Yeah, the Hitler mustache is a solid idea.?&#8221;</b><br />
<b>—Alexander, Minnesota</b></p>
<p>SG: There&#8217;s actually a neat answer for this &#8212; something we learned during Wilson&#8217;s hour at media day that exploded the whole &#8220;Media day sucks and it&#8217;s a total waste of time&#8221; narrative. In Wilson&#8217;s junior year in high school, Wilson and his father grew their hair out as a bonding thing until Wilson&#8217;s football team reached the state championship (and they won). His dad passed away in 2010, so Wilson decided to honor him right before this season by doing it again. Very cool story … and a possible Gambling Manifesto tweak if Seattle wins on Sunday. The tweak: &#8220;Never bet against God, puppies, gambling theories in Pakistan, and QBs honoring their parents in a hair-related way that already worked once.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the way, that blown-out Wilson hairdo is much more Philip Michael Thomas than Greg Gumbel. And I&#8217;m not just saying that because I wanted to post the greatest strip-joint clip in network TV history.</p>

<p><b>Q: Just read a piece on Pete Carroll&#8217;s career arc and Carroll being sandwiched by Bruce Coslet and Rich Kotite in New York. I had forgotten they weren&#8217;t the same person.</b><br />
<b>—Case, Seattle</b></p>
<p>SG: It&#8217;s your best possible explanation for Carroll&#8217;s belated success at USC and Seattle. Wouldn&#8217;t it take eight to 10 solid years for Carroll to shed the Coslet/Kotite/Jets stink?</p>
<p><b>Q: Once upon a time, your nickname for Pete Carroll was <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/060105" target="_blank">Coach Fredo</a>. But what if when Fredo was sent to Vegas (USC) to learn the casino business, he defied all odds and kicked ass? He didn&#8217;t take shit from anyone and effectively ran a casino or two. He gained confidence, learned a few valuable lessons along the way, and came out of his shell. Then he went back to New York (the NFL) and with his newfound wisdom and toughness, FREDO became the one who settled all family business and took over the Corleone family. Too big of a stretch? </b><br />
<b>—Jeremy, Portland</b></p>
<p>SG: I don&#8217;t think you could say anything is too big of a stretch with Pete Carroll. When he <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">fled from USC like it was a crime scene because he knew its program was about to get sanctioned</span> took over the Seahawks four years ago, I was still scarred enough by the Patriots/Fredo experience that … well … I <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/100420" target="_blank">wrote this</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;It took Carroll two years to destroy a Super Bowl team (in New England), and after he left, it took the Patriots two years to win a Super Bowl. You couldn&#8217;t do worse. Even Fredo has &#8216;banged two cocktail waitresses&#8217; on his résumé. Now, this was a good 10-plus years ago, and I was smoking a ton of pot back then, but I specifically remember thinking to myself in 1999, &#8220;Pete Carroll is definitely not meant to coach professional football or pick the players.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t think Carroll was meant to coach football, period. His USC experience revealed that he&#8217;s meant to recruit 18-year-olds, hop around on the sideline, pump his fists, do the rah-rah routine, design fun defenses and give likable news conferences. We already saw this routine in the NFL: His name was Herm Edwards. It&#8217;s not going to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look, I don&#8217;t know where this ranks on the &#8220;Worst Simmons Predictions&#8221; ever list &#8212; a really, really, really, really, staggeringly long list, by the way &#8212; but it has to crack the top 10. I actually find myself rooting for Carroll now, and I didn&#8217;t realize why until Jeremy from Portland summed it up so well. Seventeen years ago, in one of these very mailbags on my old website, a reader emailed me, &#8220;Pete Carroll answers the question of why Fredo was never given control of the Corleone family.&#8221; Now it&#8217;s 2014 and Fredo is one victory away from (a) avoiding the fishing boat shooting, (b) outlasting Michael and Sonny, and (c) settling all family business. He&#8217;s smart, he&#8217;s not dumb, he&#8217;s smart, and he wants his respect. I wish I could email this paragraph back to 1998 Me &#8212; he wouldn&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>(Also: 1998 Me would say, &#8220;Wait a second … you&#8217;re still writing mailbags in 2014??? That&#8217;s impossible! Weren&#8217;t you the guy who promised that you&#8217;d never become a middle-aged sportswriter? I hope you&#8217;re getting paid. (Listening.) Wait, you&#8217;re making HOW MUCH?

<b>—st1nky_diver, New York</b></p>
<p>SG: I&#8217;m answering this question in ascending tiers. Tier 1: Eli, Big Ben, Rodgers, Flacco and Brees, all of whom could absolutely use another ring for career cachet (and in Eli&#8217;s case, needs it for his Hall of Fame case). Tier 2: Andy Dalton, who could at least be remembered in a Brad Johnson/Trent Dilfer–type of way with a ring. Tier 3: Romo, Rivers and Cutler, the three guys who could reinvent themselves historically with just one ring. And Tier 4: Brady and Manning.</p>
<p>As I wrote two weeks ago, <a href="http://grantland.com/features/that-championship-mailbag-2/" target="_blank">we&#8217;ll never decide on a QB G.O.A.T.</a>, but that second title probably guarantees that Manning gets mentioned just before Brady in any &#8220;best QB ever?&#8221; argument when people are talking about Manning, Brady, Montana, Elway and Unitas (and maybe in a few years Rodgers, too). Manning&#8217;s résumé if Denver wins on Sunday: best regular-season QB ever; more passing records than anyone else; best single-season passing year ever; three Super Bowl trips; two rings. Which leads us to …</p>
<p><b>Q: Is this Super Bowl the worst possible scenario for us Boston homers? Pete Carroll versus Peyton Manning. Should we &#8230; (A) Root against Peyton and for that phony Pete Carroll, who left both the Pats and USC in flames; (B) Root for Peyton even if it means that all of your ESPN colleagues will drink the Kool-Aid and label him the G.O.A.T; or (C) Hide in my closet and hope Rex Ryan turns off the lights in MetLife Stadium before kickoff?</b><br />
<b>—Will, Boston</b></p>
<p>SG: Keep in mind, you&#8217;re asking this question to someone who changed his Super Bowl flight during the third quarter of the Pats-Denver game because he wanted to be at least 2,500 miles away from Manning winning his second Super Bowl. But I&#8217;ll try to be objective here. For Boston fans, &#8220;Brady vs. Manning&#8221; has been the &#8220;Russell vs. Wilt&#8221; or &#8220;Bird vs. Magic&#8221; for this generation. If Manning wins the Bowl, you wouldn&#8217;t say he grabs the entire upper hand in that rivalry, but he definitely grabs all five fingers. No Boston fan wants that. Even if you&#8217;re still a little bitter at Pete Carroll for screwing up a talented Pats team in the late ’90s, how can that trump the Manning-Brady stakes here? And you can&#8217;t even say, &#8220;I loved Welker, I&#8217;d love to see him get a ring,&#8221; after he intentionally or inadvertently wiped out Talib two weeks ago. (My personal stance: YOU ARE DEAD TO ME, WES WELKER.)</p>
<p>Now, throw in the Seattle component &#8212; an unquestionably tortured sports city that hasn&#8217;t won a title since 1979, suffered through some amazing so-close-and-yet-so-far Mariners seasons, got blatantly screwed by the refs in Super Bowl XL, had the Sonics stolen away from them while David Stern did everything short of helping Clay Bennett purchase the getaway car (again, congrats on 30 great years, David &#8212; the ones from 1976 to 2006), and sunk so low that they&#8217;ve spent the past few years trying to convince themselves that the MLS can be anything bigger than &#8220;Triple-A baseball with soccer players.&#8221; <em>Seattle needs this.</em> For that and a variety of other reasons, I&#8217;m riding with the 206 on Sunday.</p>
<p><b>Q: I&#8217;m sensing some real palpable anti-Denver anger from your podcast comments with Cousin Sal, so I&#8217;m predicting the following: You pick Denver to win straight up and cover the spread in your column; your actual bets (if betting was legal) will be on Denver; you will spend the entire game rooting for Seattle to destroy Denver. Billy Zima is out for revenge and somebody (Peyton) has to pay.<br />
—Tristan S., Victoria, British Columbia</b></p>
<p>SG: Come on, I&#8217;d never be that vindictive. That&#8217;s crazy talk. (Frantically checking to make sure Tristan doesn&#8217;t have access to my emails and texts this week.)</p>
<p><b>Q: In your <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Basketball-According-Sports/dp/0345520106" target="_blank">Book of Basketball</a></em>, you mention multiple times that you&#8217;ll have to rewrite it because you&#8217;ll be broke and need the money. Judging by your record on gambling this season, you might be right. You&#8217;re either a psychic or you sprayed yourself with the skunk spray and jinxed yourself. Billy Zima strikes again! Honestly, I&#8217;m loving this. At this rate, you&#8217;ll be broke by 2016 and then the <em>Book of Basketball 2.0</em> will be released soon there after. ZIMA!!! ZIMA!!! ZIMA!!!</b><br />
<b>—Josh E., Provo</b></p>
<p>SG: We&#8217;re right on pace, my friend. We&#8217;re right on pace. Hold on, it&#8217;s time for a quick tangent because nobody asked me this question and it&#8217;s illegal to make up mailbag questions. I thought for sure someone would ask what it&#8217;s like to have a Super Bowl week in New York City, especially because I am a longtime proponent of the &#8220;Super Bowl should only be hosted by Miami, San Diego and New Orleans in a three-city rotation and that&#8217;s it&#8221; theory. Of course, I&#8217;m also the same guy <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/070129" target="_blank">who once wrote this</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Either way, the Super Bowl should be given only to cities that double as bachelor party destinations or feasible destinations for a <em>Real World</em> season. Think about it. If you were a best man throwing a bachelor party, you&#8217;d never say the words, &#8216;Hey, guys, we&#8217;re going to Jacksonville!&#8217; If you were an MTV executive planning a <em>Real World</em> season, you&#8217;d never say, &#8216;Hey, what about Houston?&#8217; So why would we hold the Super Bowl in those places? Isn&#8217;t Super Bowl week supposed to be fun?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well … New York City definitely passes the bachelor party/<em>Real World</em> test. And then some. It&#8217;s been freezing cold all week, obviously, but here&#8217;s a news flash: Jacksonville 2005 and Dallas 2011 weren&#8217;t exactly St. Bart&#8217;s. It&#8217;s going to be an absolute pain in the ass to get to and from MetLife Stadium, but you could say that about a variety of Super Bowls (Glendale 2008, anyone?). There are more than enough hotels and restaurants and bars and late-night food options and cabs and things-to-do-that-can&#8217;t-be-printed, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my only nitpick: <em>It doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s the Super Bowl.</em> I&#8217;ve been here since Monday &#8212; it feels like any other week I&#8217;ve ever spent in New York City. You wouldn&#8217;t even know it was hosting the Super Bowl save for the 10-block stretch they carved out near Times Square. The best thing about attending the Super Bowl is that nonstop feeling of, &#8220;Cool, this is awesome, I&#8217;m at the Super Bowl!&#8221; Everywhere you look and everything you do reminds you of that. That&#8217;s why everyone appreciated the Indianapolis Super Bowl so much, actually &#8212; for everyone living there and working there, it was like their whole life revolved around making every visitor enjoy Super Bowl week. New York City is just being New York City. If Jacksonville was severely overmatched by the Super Bowl, then New York is the one and only American city that has actually <em>overpowered</em> the Super Bowl. It&#8217;s an overqualified host. I don&#8217;t know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.</p>
<p>The one great outcome here: possibly, a cold-weather football game that FEELS like a real football game, where real men decide the title and stuff. I&#8217;m excited for that more than anything. An old-school, cold-weather, kick-ass football game that couldn&#8217;t have unfolded the same way in a dome or a warm-weather venue would single-handedly swing my verdict toward &#8220;YES!&#8221; Anyway, I&#8217;ve been to 11 of the last 13 Super Bowl weeks (only missing Tampa and Detroit). Ranking those cities in order from &#8220;best host&#8221; to &#8220;worst host&#8221;: New Orleans/Miami (tie), San Diego, Indianapolis, New York, Phoenix/Scottsdale, Dallas, Houston, Jacksonville, Jacksonville again, Jacksonville a third time. Whether New York climbs past Indy and San Diego remains to be seen. All right, back to the Super Bag.</p>
<p><b>Q: Your picks this year were as hard to read as watching Obama throw the opening pitch like a woman. Please pick against the Seahawks for the Super Bowl.</b><br />
<b>—Joe, Dana Point</b></p>
<p>SG: I&#8217;m thinking about it. We&#8217;re getting close to make-a-pick time.</p>
<p><b>Q: I&#8217;m interested to know if you think On Golden Blonde is the most extraordinary porno since Shaving Ryan&#8217;s Privates.</b><br />
—<b>Randy E., Oakland</b></p>
<p>SG: That was our 48th email. Look, at that, we&#8217;re suddenly in range! Bonus round!</p>
<p><b>Q: I finally got the balls and the idea to send you an email. Four words. German Shepard Pro Bowl. Here&#8217;s the idea, QB has his five guys and the ball is snapped. As soon as the ball leaves his hands 11 police German Sheperds are let loose to follow wherever the ball goes (they&#8217;re trained to follow the ball in this scenario and everyone is wearing appropriate gear). I don&#8217;t see anything  terrifying Jimmy Graham more than 11 dogs being let loose to get him as soon or before the ball gets to him. Thoughts?</b><br />
<b>—Cody, Dearborn Heights, Michigan</b></p>

<p><b>Q: On the lameness scale, how high is watching the Super Bowl at home alone with your wife? No buddies, no poker, no profanity, no drinking. Please list the things you would rather do than watch the Super Bowl at home alone with your wife. I typed that again because I still can&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing on Sunday.</b><br />
<b>—Neil, Ottawa</b></p>
<p>SG: Closer …</p>
<p><b>Q: I need your infinite wisdom. Just got home from a great first date in Atwater Village with a girl I met online. I ordered a chai latte and a greek yogurt parfait, drizzled with organic honey with blackberries, blueberries and raspberries. I told my roommate this and he said my order alone had relegated me strictly to friend zone status with this girl forever. What&#8217;s your take?</b><br />

<p><b>Q: My tongue has been hurting me for awhile now and I finally went to the doctor today. First thing he asks me after looking at my tongue was if I had been eating a lot of cinnamon lately. I immediately started laughing and told him I drink a lot of fireball (had to explain to him cinnamon whiskey) and he Seems to think this is the problem. It&#8217;s quite coincidental that he led with that question if you ask me. He put me on the fireball DL for 2-3 weeks which if I actually adhere, will be an awful time. My only hope is &#8220;fireball tongue&#8221; will forever be known as Brian Linner Disease (BLD) ala Lou Gehrig which is good news for Bud Light since my intake will skyrocket considering no fireball to compete with.</b><br />

<p>SG: Yup, these are my readers.</p>
<p>All right, time for my big Super Bowl pick: Broncos minus-2.5 or Seahawks +2.5??? For the record, I thought about pulling a Berman and making this pick worth 35 games, in a last-ditch attempt to finish over .500 this season, before realizing that would be ridiculous. I got crushed this season. Shit happens. This spring, I&#8217;m killing off Billy Zima and coming back stronger than ever next season. By Labor Day 2014, they&#8217;ll be throwing me in this montage.</p>

<p>Anyway …</p>
<p><strong>Why You Regretted Taking Denver:</strong> You took a great offense over a great defense even when <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/a-history-of-offense-vs-defense-super-bowls/" target="_blank">history says you should do the opposite</a>. You got seduced by a very good Broncos team that looked like a juggernaut because it played an easy regular-season schedule, then beat a 9-7 Chargers team and a ludicrously depleted Pats team at home in Rounds 2 and 3 … and you forgot that Seattle had a much tougher road from Week 1. You forgot that Russell Wilson might be special, and that Beast Mode can be pretty frightening to wager against. You didn&#8217;t realize that <a href="http://grantland.com/features/whos-laughing-now/" target="_blank">Seattle&#8217;s Cover 3 defense</a> was created to frustrate someone like Manning, or that Seattle&#8217;s defense would punish him and his receivers all game long. You hoped Seattle wouldn&#8217;t make one big special teams play (but it did), and that the colder weather wouldn&#8217;t bother Manning as the game went along (and it did). You forgot about the Manning Face. You didn&#8217;t care that Seattle had a better all-around team and a decidedly healthier team (and you should have). You went with the general public, who threw their money behind Manning for two weeks (and you should have known better). You are the reasons that bookies drive BMWs and casinos keep getting built.</p>
<p><strong>Why You Regretted Taking Seattle:</strong> You forgot that San Francisco had Seattle in that title game and let it off the hook. You forgot that it&#8217;s REALLY hard for Seattle to top 24 points against a good defense, and that it&#8217;s just about impossible for Denver NOT to score 24 points. You forgot that Denver&#8217;s D has been swallowing up the run lately, which means young (repeat: young) Russell Wilson will probably have to win this one for Seattle. You forgot that Denver&#8217;s O-line has done a masterful job of protecting Manning all season, and that he&#8217;ll have plenty of time to pick apart that Cover 3. You forgot that he&#8217;s playing in MetLife Stadium, and that the karma of Peyton tying Eli&#8217;s two rings on Eli&#8217;s turf after Eli passed him on Peyton&#8217;s turf is just too perfect. You forgot that it&#8217;s been Peyton&#8217;s season since Week 1 &#8212; seven TDs, Thursday night, Baltimore &#8212; and that his out-of-body experience has even spread to him being able to control the weather. You forgot that this journey can&#8217;t end any other way &#8212; more heartbreak for Seattle fans, the ultimate storybook start-to-finish season for Peyton Manning, all the &#8220;Greatest QB Ever!&#8221; talk flipping into full swing. Most of all, you forgot how spiteful Billy Zima is.</p>
<p><strong>The Pick:</strong> Denver 22, Seattle 19</p>
<p><strong><em>Playoffs: 3-5-2<br />
Season: 111-145-10</em></strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=99237&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The unlikely rise of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, Hollywood's majorly hated, hugely successful kings of the modern-day spoof.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=99101&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Jason and Aaron don’t actually give interviews.” That&#8217;s what I was told when I attempted to connect with spoof-movie maestros Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.</p>
<p>Their handlers weren&#8217;t joking. You may not have heard of Friedberg and Seltzer. Their lives have been shrouded in J.D. Salinger–like mystery. But somehow, some way, you&#8217;ve seen their movies. The writing-directing duo, best known as “two of the six writers of <i>Scary Movie</i>,” are among the most consistently successful in all of Hollywood. The movies in their bluntly titled filmography — <i>Date Movie</i>, <i>Epic Movie</i>, <i>Disaster Movie</i>, the <i>300</i>-inspired <i>Meet the Spartans</i>, the <i>Twilight</i> parody <i>Vampires Suck</i>, and most recently <i>The Starving Games</i> (you can probably guess that one) — has grossed more than half a billion dollars worldwide. But a quick search unearths little connection between the comedic duo and their audience. Appearances, interviews, and general face time aren&#8217;t part of the equation for Friedberg and Seltzer. It&#8217;s hard to blame them.</p>
<p>What <i>does</i> show up when you Google “Friedberg and Seltzer” is a frightening level of Internet vitriol. There&#8217;s the routine hate: reviews and lists decrying their lowbrow humor with name-calling and “worst of” superlatives. And then there&#8217;s backlash only Friedberg and Seltzer seem to provoke. There are anti–Friedberg and Seltzer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrLQcDwPkno" target="_blank">PSAs</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnn2-KtZ4W4" target="_blank">petitions</a> calling for the end of their careers, and <a href="http://www.hockey-fights.com/forum/showtopic.php?tid/511976/post/937128/" target="_blank">forum threads</a> with titles like “I HOPE THESE 2 GUYS DIE OF ANAL CANCER.” A video purporting to be a behind-the-scenes look at their writing process is itself satire, dreamed up by two comedians:</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/iPi2O4A7_zg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>For the level of negativity directed at the two filmmakers whenever they dish out a new spoof, there&#8217;s also a substantial amount of effort spent keeping them in the crosshairs. “Lots of comedies are accused of insulting our intelligence, but their movies feel so cynically constructed that we literally feel insulted by them,” said Kenny Byerly, the writing-process video&#8217;s Friedberg proxy. “It actually is not any different than bad YouTube parodies or BuzzFeed&#8217;s recognizable-reference click bait, but YouTube parodies are by amateurs or underdogs, so they don&#8217;t merit the same scorn. Friedberg and Seltzer are guys who seemingly made it in Hollywood, yet seem content to churn out joyless, lazy trash. The big question to me, dramatized in the sketch, is whether they are really that unfunny, or whether they are really that cynical. Are they lucky idiots? Or trapped in a career that&#8217;s beneath them? I don&#8217;t know.”</p>
<p>Three months after <em>The </em><i>Starving Games</i>, a new Friedberg and Seltzer picture was arriving in theaters and, finally, the mad scientists of pop-culture Frankenstein-ing were ready to talk. I couldn&#8217;t meet them (requests to do so are quietly dismissed) and follow-up communication would go unaddressed (“Did we mention they don&#8217;t do interviews?”). But the duo did break their own rule: one phone conversation, for one hour. Friedberg and Seltzer would speak.</p>
<p>Carefully, but willingly. They have a good reason: Their latest, <i>Best Night Ever</i>, isn&#8217;t a spoof. In the vein of <i>Project X</i> and a new breed of found-footage comedies, the film follows a quartet of young women blazing through the Las Vegas night for one epic bachelorette party. All the Friedberg and Seltzer tropes are there — slapstick injuries, bathroom humor, wisecracks at the expense of body types both big and small — but <i>Best Night Ever</i> leans hard on its R rating and is noticeably devoid of random pop-star impersonations. When Friedberg and Seltzer rang me, there was nothing but excitement in their voices. They seemed untouched by the dissenters. But if the world around them weren&#8217;t so vicious, there would be little logic in the duo sticking to the shadows.</p>
<p>“It felt so good to be in R-rated territory,” Friedberg, 42, said. “We’ve done only PG-13 since <i>Scary Movie</i>, and the comedy is completely outrageous. We went four, five rounds with the ratings board just to get an R rating. After <i>Best Night Ever</i>, no one will accuse us of not going for it.”</p>
<p>The complaints hurled at Friedberg and Seltzer&#8217;s efforts typically have little to do with whether they “go for it” or not. But even if <i>Best Night Ever</i> is once again annihilated critically, the two won&#8217;t hear it. They&#8217;ve achieved a Zen state as Hollywood&#8217;s purveyors of not giving a shit. As Seltzer put it: “We love writing, we love directing, we love the actors we work with. We have our own families that we raised. Jason has kids, I have kids, we have wives, so we don’t sit around [reading reactions]. Honestly, we don’t have a lot of ego that needs to be stroked. We don’t want to be condemned, but we don’t pay that much attention. We just kind of do our work.”</p>
<p>Anyone blaming Friedberg and Seltzer for the oversaturation of spoof comedies should take it up with Hollywood. These are the movies it wants. They are merely vessels for an industry&#8217;s desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>“I, at one time, wanted to be an artist,” Seltzer, 40, recalled of his stint at UC Santa Barbara, the roseate state school where as an art history major he first crossed paths with Friedberg, a history major. The two were kindred spirits: focused on their studies, harboring a love for movies, and working like madmen to pay their way through college. Film school was off their radar. “We caught on too late,” Friedberg said. “I think it was in the last semester I took Scorsese 101. I was like, &#8216;So you can just watch <i>Goodfellas</i> and cool movies? That’s what you can do in college?&#8217; I felt really stupid.”</p>
<p>Friedberg and Seltzer&#8217;s comedy diet was riddled with all the staples: <i>Caddyshack</i>, <i>Airplane!</i>, <i>The Simpsons</i>, <em>The </em><i>Naked Gun</i>. They were children of the late &#8217;70s with fathers obsessed with movie comedy. They arrived to UCSB well educated in the art of silliness and bonded over a shared sense of humor. Scorsese was the revelation that put them on the filmmaking path.</p>
<p>“<i>Goodfellas</i> was amazing to us,” Friedberg said. “I remember one day we said it could be funny if there was a spoof movie where, &#8216;Funny how? Like I&#8217;m a clown? I’m here to amuse you?&#8217; — and then you cut to the guy and he’s wearing full clown makeup.” Instead of pining for the film school experience, Friedberg and Seltzer took a proactive approach and began work on their first screenplay. As Friedberg put it, “That dumb-ass joke started it all.”</p>
<p>But Friedberg and Seltzer were also hustling to pay tuition, comfortable taking on unglamorous jobs that put cash in their pockets. The two were entrepreneurs at heart. They sold homemade T-shirts, started their own food delivery service, and when graduation rolled around, they went into the Seltzer family business: shoes. Just 22 years old, Friedberg and Seltzer — convinced by the latter&#8217;s salesman father — opened two shoe stores in Los Angeles. By day, they sold espadrilles. By night, they toiled away at screenplays.</p>
<p>Any honest Hollywood success story begins with a “someone you know.” For the writing partners, it was Friedberg&#8217;s father, Rick, who had directed an assortment of TV commercials and music videos, including Van Halen&#8217;s “Hot for Teacher,” Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen&#8217;s &#8220;Brother for Sale,&#8221; and Kenny G&#8217;s “Against Doctor&#8217;s Orders,” which paired the jazz saxophonist with Dudley Moore. The elder Friedberg had made the jump to features earlier in his career, with the 1980 TV movie <i>Pray TV</i> and 1983’s <i>Off the Wall</i>, a goofball comedy starring Paul Sorvino that Roger Ebert called “one of the most lame-brained movies of recent years.” When his son came to him with the first draft of a secret-agent spoof called <i>Spy Hard</i>, Rick was shooting <i>Bad Golf Made Easier</i>, a series of golf instruction parody videos starring Leslie Nielsen. Sculpted in the mold of Zucker brothers and Mel Brooks comedies, <i>Spy Hard</i> appealed directly to the heart of its future star.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/7y3E1NaB5n0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>“We just wrote what we thought would be funny and we never really thought it would go anywhere,” Seltzer said of the James Bond riff. “Like all kids, you’re sort of fearless — [you] just kind of write it and you don’t ever think anyone will really read it or get it. Or read it and <i>laugh</i>.”</p>
<p><i>Spy Hard</i> made Nielsen, then the Cary Grant of spoofs, laugh — and that was everything. In the pre–<i>Austin Powers</i> world, the project quickly found a home at Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Pictures with Rick Friedberg in the director&#8217;s chair. The sale of the script and the film&#8217;s modest success imbued the younger Friedberg and Seltzer with confidence. “Leslie Nielsen liked it, and we assumed that he had good taste,” joked Seltzer. Good enough taste to close shop on the shoe stores and pursue screenwriting full time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>Friedberg and Seltzer arrived in Hollywood ready to keep the momentum of <i>Spy Hard</i> going with completed scripts and honed pitches. But the process was … slow. “I think we thought once you have a movie made, that the world opens up to you, but it really doesn’t,” Seltzer said. “You have to kind of keep creating your own opportunities.”</p>
<p>Their post–<i>Spy Hard</i> break came when they sold <i>The Bridge</i> to Columbia Pictures, eyed as a vehicle for Jackie Chan. It was a departure from their spoof debut, a martial arts movie that solidified Friedberg and Seltzer as competent action writers. But in what would become a common refrain for the writers, Chan&#8217;s asking price kept the movie from being realized. Luckily, Columbia had other work for the team. They were tasked with a page-one rewrite of Jean-Claude Van Damme&#8217;s 1996 film <i>Maximum Risk</i>. Producer Moshe Diamant hoped Friedberg and Seltzer could inject the story with the same action they&#8217;d displayed in <i>The Bridge</i>. The writing partners delivered what they call a “hard-core cop movie,” a script that quickly earned a green light. But as is commonplace in Hollywood, it also earned a full-blown rewrite from “million-dollar-a-week writers” who churned out another “chop-sock sort of Van Damme movie.”</p>
<p>More jobs came along — after <i>Maximum Risk</i>, Friedberg and Seltzer sold an animated movie to Disney that “turned into <i>Cars</i>” and later an adaptation of Christopher Buckley&#8217;s <i>Little Green Men</i> — but they were still just that: <i>jobs</i>. The duo still think of one stalled project as “the one that got away”: <i>Liberace</i>, a biopic of the closeted pianist-singer that gestated for more than a decade before Steven Soderbergh realized his version for HBO. Written on spec in the late ’90s, the script attracted the attention of Peter Safran, who would go on to become Friedberg and Seltzer&#8217;s steady producer. In 2000, the movie found a home at producer Cary Woods&#8217;s Independent Pictures, with Philip Kaufman (<i>The Right Stuff</i>) set to direct and the writing team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (<i>The People vs. Larry Flynt</i>) producing. The script attracted A-list stars: Robin Williams, Johnny Depp, and Nicolas Cage were each attached to the project at one point. Friedberg and Seltzer said they spent two years flying back and forth between Los Angeles and San Francisco tinkering with the script under Kaufman&#8217;s watch. And then, nothing.</p>
<p>“There’s a reason why the Steven Soderbergh one ended up being on HBO,” Safran said. “It was a tough one to get done as a theatrical picture. You needed to have enough money to really make it look great, and that era and the glitz and glam of Vegas. The way any movie comes together, I guess … There are a million reasons.”</p>
<p>Concurrent with the progress of <i>Liberace</i>, Friedberg and Seltzer prepped another spec, a horror spoof called <i>Scream If You Know What I Did Last Summer</i>, which would become <i>Scary Movie</i>. It was a pitch they loved — and no one in Hollywood would touch it.<b> </b>“Imagine us pitching, &#8216;He pulls her panties down and her giant bush fills the entire frame and he grabs a weed whacker to whack it down,&#8217;” recalled Friedberg. &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN8dxsvxkcI" target="_blank">It actually made the movie</a>, but in pitch form it sounds ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We pitched it because we believed in it so much,” Seltzer added.</p>
<p>Friedberg and Seltzer returned from their failed pitch tour still high on the idea. With a mix of recklessness and fearlessness, they decided to write the script anyway. When the spec was complete, Safran shopped <i>Scary Movie</i> around a second time. Nearly every studio showed them the door, until they got to Dimension Films, which snatched up the crude-humored draft in 1998. When <a href="http://variety.com/1998/film/news/horror-spec-enters-new-dimension-1117481692/" target="_blank">the deal was announced in <i>Variety</i></a>, Dimension founder Bob Weinstein commented, “This is a hilarious script.”</p>
<p>Before Friedberg and Seltzer became “two of the six writers of <i>Scary Movie</i>,” they were “two of the two writers of <i>Scary Movie</i>.” Bob and Harvey Weinstein courted the legendary David Zucker (<i>Airplane!</i>, the <i>Naked Gun</i> franchise) for the director&#8217;s chair. When the film became a Wayans brothers production, Friedberg and Seltzer stepped aside to continue developing <i>Liberace</i> and penning other projects for the Weinsteins, including an unproduced talking-animal spoof in the vein of <i>Babe</i>.<a class="footnote-link" href="#fn-60"><sup id="ss-60">60</sup></a></p>
<p>Seltzer estimates that throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he and Friedberg sold upward of 40 scripts, a majority based on original ideas, with a few book adaptations and work-for-hire jobs scattered throughout. Their names were all over <i>Scary Movie</i> when it earned $157 million in the summer of 2000. It brought in a swell of new work: a <i>Looney Tunes</i> movie for Ivan Reitman; <i>Happy Place</i>, a <i>Groundhog Day</i>–esque comedy about a man who finds himself trapped in his mental safe zone only to discover it&#8217;s a living hell; a debauched mockumentary called <i>The Bachelor Party</i>; and an adaptation of Sid and Marty Krofft&#8217;s <i>H.R. Pufnstuf</i>, a project again shepherded by Alexander and Karaszewski. Those seasoned screenwriters would often go to bat for Friedberg and Seltzer as the less experienced pair grew as writers, even responding in comments to those who wrote off the <i>Liberace</i> script because of their work on <i>Scary Movie</i>. <a href="http://www.hollywood-elsewhere.com/2006/07/liberace-script/" target="_blank">Responding to Internet skepticism, Karaszewski once wrote:</a> “Aaron and Jason are trying to change like we did by following <i>Problem Child</i> with <i>Ed Wood</i>. It can happen.”</p>
<p>People who write movies want to see those movies made. So when New Regency still hadn&#8217;t found an established comedy director for Friedberg and Seltzer&#8217;s rom-com spoof <em>Date Movie</em>, the duo decided not to sit back and let this one languish in limbo. Friedberg and Seltzer threw themselves into an elaborate presentation of storyboards and visual gags to sell themselves to the company. It worked. “For us, who had only been writers for years and years, to actually hear actors saying our lines and see our characters living and breathing, and seeing what you’ve created on a blank page is thrilling and still is thrilling,” Friedberg said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_99137" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 586px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-99137" alt="Friedberg (left) and Seltzer with their spouses in 2006." src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/friedberg-seltzer-date-night-features.jpg?w=576&#038;h=382" width="576" height="382" /><figcaption><p class="wp-caption-text credit">Friedberg (left) and Seltzer with their spouses in 2006.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Budgeted between $15 million and $20 million and parodying everything imaginable, including <i>Bridget Jones&#8217;s Diary</i>, <i>Hitch</i>, <i>Meet the Parents</i>, <i>Kill Bill</i>, and <i>King Kong</i>, <i>Date Movie</i> was a hit for Team Friedberg-Seltzer. It was also a gateway drug. In an unforgiving industry, the spoof was a profitable, viable format that could be tapped for endless possibilities.</p>
<p>“We like to work,” Seltzer said. “And [we] know how difficult it is to get a movie made. So if you have a movie that worked financially, then the studios are much more apt to do that again than something more original.”</p>
<p>After <i>Date Movie</i> and its spiritual sequel, <i>Epic Movie</i>, the two set up a holiday comedy at New Regency, a twist on <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, that was touted as Rainn Wilson&#8217;s first big starring role after breaking out on <i>The Office</i>. Days before production was to begin, the studio pulled the plug over budget concerns. “So they don’t do it, and you’re disappointed for a beat, and then you go, &#8216;Well, OK, what about this?&#8217;&#8221; Seltzer said. &#8220;And then we sold them <i>Meet the Spartans</i>, [which] was a little bit more digestible, and it was something we could have a lot of fun with. They liked the script and they go, &#8216;OK, yeah, we could feel financially secure about that and you guys could do what you need to do.&#8217;”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>Friedberg and Seltzer&#8217;s spoof-writing process is like the refining of crude oil. Safran, who has produced each of the duo&#8217;s films since <i>Scary Movie</i>, said the most divisive conversations take place early on, when the team is considering the target. The genre or franchise needs to be “sufficiently iconic” and “so earnest that it’s basically begging to be lampooned.” With a blueprint of the plot in hand, the writers go to town on jokes. Imagine a typical night in a freshman dorm, a couple of 18-year-old boys hopped up on Mountain Dew, playing video games, and trying to make each other laugh, and you have a Friedberg and Seltzer writing session.</p>
<p>“It’s just like being with your oldest, best friend all the time, every day,” Friedberg said. “You don’t know why, you just brainstorm dialogue. The stuff that comes out between you, for better or worse, is just your creation. And I think Aaron and I never set limits or rules. Our process … is just much more free-form.”</p>
<p>The <i>Naked Gun</i> team of David Zucker, Jerry Zucker, and Jim Abrahams is well known for abiding by <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-07-26/entertainment/9103230124_1_joke-falklands-war-naked-gun" target="_blank">a list of comedy rules that dictate</a> whether a joke will play or test an audience&#8217;s tolerance (e.g., “A joke happening in the background must be related in some way to the action in the foreground”). Friedberg and Seltzer don&#8217;t approach material with rigid standards. In the end, it&#8217;s about hitting the beat, eliciting the laugh. Seltzer insists their scripts are forged with time, energy, and attention to story coherence. More topical jokes are penned in the days leading up to the shoot or completely devised on set. In the years since <i>Date Movie</i>, there have been vague allusions to Friedberg and Seltzer productions <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/the-surreally-incompetent-inot-another-not-another-91699" target="_blank">enlisting outside comedians to pen jokes</a> for their films, but Safran says this isn&#8217;t the case, at least not of late. “Generally, they don&#8217;t hear joke pitches from anyone else,” he said. So what we see onscreen is the brainchild of Friedberg and Seltzer, weeks of holing up in an office, bouncing ideas around, and seeing what sticks.</p>
<p>The men are only moderately concerned about shelf life; <i>Meet the Spartans</i> contains multiple references to shaved-head, mental-breakdown-era Britney Spears — once, when she&#8217;s kicked down the bottomless pit by King Leonidas, another when Chris Crocker&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc" target="_blank">“Leave Britney alone!” YouTube video</a> appears on the video monitor chest of a Transformer robot. The actual impersonation, by <i>MADtv</i> alum Nicole Parker, was nearly cut from the film. “We thought that actually might be on the edge of being too old,” Seltzer admitted. But in the end, that bit of pop-culture schadenfreude played like gangbusters in test screenings. It became a keystone of <i>Meet the Spartans</i>’ trailers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_99136" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 586px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-99136" alt="Meet the Spartans" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/meet-the-spartans-features.jpg?w=576&#038;h=311" width="576" height="311" /><figcaption><p class="wp-caption-text credit"><em>Meet the Spartans</em></p></figcaption></figure>
<p>“We do our best and try to foresee what will last — and 10 years from now, probably a lot of the references seem dated,” Seltzer said. Friedberg finishes the thought: “So maybe we don’t have the same shelf life for that joke, but it’s a movie filled with hundreds of jokes, so if one feels a little old or dated, it doesn’t take down the whole value of the movie. You still throw <i>Spartans</i> on [and] it’s still goofy and funny and makes fun of <i>300</i>.”</p>
<p>Channeling their 18-year-old selves serves the business side, too. When they pitch an idea or describe the method to their madness, it sounds like gold. And they&#8217;re still entrepreneurs, capable of mimicking $150 million production value with only $15 million in their pockets. The duo suggest that&#8217;s the real challenge they face each time they pen a script. They want the movies to feel big, with major guest stars and lavish production values. “Ambition is the thing that gives us the most anxiety,” Seltzer said. So they shoot and shoot and shoot, maximizing every dollar spent.</p>
<p>Friedberg and Seltzer were able to attract a steady cast and crew that have returned for each of their movies. Oscar-nominated production designer William Elliott (<i>The Untouchables</i>) has been onboard since <i>Date Movie</i>, tasked with re-creating such elaborate sets as Willy Wonka&#8217;s factory, the temples of Sparta, and <i>Disaster Movie</i>’s apocalypse-torn metropolis. Diedrich Bader, Tony Cox, Jennifer Coolidge, and Fred Willard have been recurring players in the Friedberg and Seltzer troupe. Seltzer says Carmen Electra, who has appeared in four of their films, is only paid scale because when she&#8217;s on their set, “she wants to work and she works really hard at it.” Safran is ebullient about Friedberg and Seltzer&#8217;s tightly run ship, an operation he attributes to their deep bond. “They’ll kill for each other,” he said of the directors, cast, and crew.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<figure id="attachment_99135" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width: 586px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-99135" alt="Friedberg and Seltzer with the cast of Best Night Ever." src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/best-night-ever-premiere-features.jpg?w=576&#038;h=384" width="576" height="384" /><figcaption><p class="wp-caption-text credit">Friedberg and Seltzer with the cast of <em>Best Night Ever</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, critics have not been kind to the Friedberg and Seltzer oeuvre. Of the films they wrote and directed, <i>Date Movie</i> peaks on Rotten Tomatoes with a 7 percent fresh score. Last year, critic and author Nathan Rabin wrote that Friedberg and Seltzer are “comic terrorists who cavalierly destroy what others create for their own ugly self-interest.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the first movie, you’re always surprised, like, &#8216;Oh, wow, we’re not getting a 100 Rotten Tomatoes score?&#8217;” Seltzer said. “And then you go, &#8216;It’s not a critic’s cup of tea,&#8217; and some people don’t like it and then you move on. Otherwise, you go crazy.”</p>
<p>Though they&#8217;ve shut out the criticism, Friedberg and Seltzer are aware their movies aren&#8217;t playing well to a vocal community. They don&#8217;t resent the assault. Occasionally, they embrace it. For the <i>Date Movie</i> DVD, the directors invited <i>L.A. Weekly</i> film critic Scott Foundas (who hated the movie) and <i>Los Angeles Daily News</i> film critic Bob Strauss (who landed somewhere in the middle) to participate in an audio commentary. In the session, Foundas and Strauss were free to critique the work. They happily obliged. &#8220;If you went to a dinner theater in Florida and saw some kind of road-show company doing a movie [spoof], this is what it might look like,” Foundas says on the track.</p>
<p>Is sophomoric humor allowed to target actual sophomores without contaminating culture? Everyone involved seems to think so. “Their movies are <i>obviously</i> not made for a very broad audience,” Safran said. “It’s mostly that teen demographic, but that teen demographic seems to really enjoy it. When you sit in the theater and watch <i>Meet the Spartans</i> or <i>Vampires Suck</i> with a group of teens, they are absolutely loving it.”</p>
<p>Testing the movies in front of audiences is a huge part of Friedberg, Seltzer, and Safran&#8217;s process. Reviews and Cinemascores (a letter-grade rating based on audience reactions) be damned — the spoof team knows their movies are working when they hear the reactions of the audiences they&#8217;re hoping to reach. When they compile a test audience reaction, they don&#8217;t reach for huge swaths of the public: Safran says they don&#8217;t even bother testing for viewers over 25 years old, and that many early screenings are tested for predominantly Latino and African American audiences, for whom the parody films generally play well.</p>
<p>Seltzer described the test-screening process, where jokes live and die by reactions. “You have Arnon Milchan there, who runs New Regency, and the audience has to tell you the truth, right? So they have to laugh their asses off to justify the joke. And if not, we’re going to cut it, or we’re going to edit something else. So I think that’s the sort of barometer. People have to laugh, they have to like it, and if we throw a lot of jokes in there, and if they work, great, and if not, we’ll take things out and leave in the one great joke that did work.”</p>
<p>As purveyors of silly comedy, Friedberg and Seltzer are employed to keep the laughs coming rapid-fire. But certain jokes are shown the door — the two said their biggest fights are over “back-of-the-room” jokes that often fly over audiences&#8217; heads. A few will creep into the final cut, but in the end, the goal is to craft popular entertainment. &#8220;The studio sort of expects that brand of humor,&#8221; Seltzer said. &#8220;Spoof movies, they have a lot of jokes per minute, much more than a normal comedy that has to have maybe a richer narrative. You have to have big belly laughs; you have to have people screech at some things. We just go for it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>
<p>Friedberg and Seltzer are deep in postproduction on their latest film, <i>SuperFast!</i> — a parody of the <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i> franchise they say is light on random pop-culture references thanks to the abundance of opportunities Vin Diesel&#8217;s auto-racing cash cow affords them. It&#8217;s still unclear what company will distribute the movie. After <i>Vampires Suck</i>, which earned $80.5 million worldwide, Friedberg, Seltzer, and Safran walked away from their relationship with New Regency to produce their films independently. This enabled Safran&#8217;s company to presell their next endeavor, <i>The Starving Games</i>, to foreign markets and distributors to pay for the production, putting less pressure on the end product and, theoretically, giving Friedberg and Seltzer more creative control.</p>
<p><em>The Starving Games</em> was released by distribution start-up Ketchup Entertainment simultaneously in theaters and on VOD mere weeks before <em>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</em> — a first for a Friedberg-Seltzer spoof. Safran is unsure if the new business model will help <i>The Starving Games </i>turn a profit, but in the case of <i>Best Night Ever</i>, released by Magnolia Pictures in a similar VOD-to-theatrical slow-build, the producer sees it as only an asset to his creative partners.</p>
<p>“You know, [Friedberg and Seltzer] had a real desire to broaden their horizons,” he said. “They’ve been making spoof movies for the last six, seven years, and obviously they have creative desires beyond making spoof movies. We felt that if we made something at this kind of price, we can do it with complete freedom. That we would be able to make exactly the movie they want to make, cast whoever they want to cast … it would be the purest form of creation. You don’t have to reach as wide an audience.”</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been sitting on the <i>Best Night Ever</i> script for a few years — both men acknowledge that it was born in the wake of <i>The Hangover</i> and <i>Bridesmaids</i>, but that doesn&#8217;t dampen their excitement. Safran calls the movie “raunchy” and “balls to the wall,” but his most accurate descriptor might be “niche.” It&#8217;s a reasonable description for his two collaborators. Friedberg and Seltzer can deliver a movie fit for 2,500 screens, comedy with all the delicacy of an automatic shotgun. They drive children into fits of laughter and well-read adults into depression. Friedberg and Seltzer can deliver those movies and will. Even Kenny Byerly, that vocal critic of the duo, simply can&#8217;t help but sympathize with their standing in an unforgiving Hollywood environment: “Many of their haters would probably take the same deal.”</p>
<p>But the requirements of their job seem to be loosening. They&#8217;re taking chances. They&#8217;re injecting more personality into their scripts, however boorish. They&#8217;re continuing to tune out the faceless protestors who demand their heads on stakes. They&#8217;re sticking to their guns, and not taking anything too seriously. They&#8217;re coming out of the woodwork and finally talking to people. Carefully.</p>
<p>During our conversation, I told tell them it&#8217;s a brave choice, particularly in the caustic landscape they&#8217;re likely to encounter. Maybe a little dangerous.</p>
<p>“The two adjectives they never ascribe to two Jewish screenwriters are &#8216;brave&#8217; and &#8216;dangerous,&#8217;” Friedberg responded.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s funny.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Now, as Stern leaves after 30 years on the job, there is a natural tendency to treat him as though he were some complicated hybrid of Henry Ford, Don Draper, and Rick Rubin. Much of that is true, but it’s only half the story.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=98552&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was late at night in an NBA hospitality suite in an L.A. hotel. It was during one of those Celtics-Lakers championship series in the mid-1980s when the league was really taking off. You knew that because odd, interesting people were turning up around the bar. I believe that night’s special celebrity guest was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Stills" target="_blank">Stephen Stills</a>, who was accompanied by the great session keyboardist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Finnigan" target="_blank">Mike Finnigan</a>. Even a roomful of half-lit sportswriters can be classed by the presence of a guy listed on the <i>Electric Ladyland</i> liner notes, a credit for which a lot of musicians would sell their white-haired grandmothers to Somali pirates.</p>
<p>Anyway, long about midnight, commissioner David Stern came down, grabbed a beer, sat down on the couch, and gabbed with whoever wandered by — and there was a lot of wandering going on at this point in the evening. Someone — I don’t recall who, but I suspect it was a member of the NBA&#8217;s PR crew — ordered up a whole raft of those single-serving pizzas for which America’s finer chain hotels regularly overcharge the guests who need a snack at two in the morning. At which point, someone winged one of the pizzas across the room, over the commissioner’s head, and smack into the wall above him. Someone else then put a hat on the bar, and thus was declared open the first (and, as far as I know, only) &#8220;Hit the Commissioner With a Pizza for a Buck&#8221; contest. If you put a dollar in the hat — all the money went to charity — you could scale one of the pizzas at the league’s boss, as long as you didn’t hit him, because the someones involved all liked and wanted to keep their jobs. A respectable fusillade erupted. Stern sat there with remarkable aplomb as cheese and tomato shrapnel exploded over his head until he finally stood up. “The hell with this,” he said, and left the room to raucous applause.</p>
<p>And, anyway, that’s the first time I ever saw David Stern, who already had turned the NBA into something that attracted the random rock-and-roll star and was on his way to turning it into so much more, for good and for ill. So much was still in the future. Michael Jordan was just coming into his own after spending his formative NBA years on a team where the second-best player was Orlando Woolridge. Yao Ming was merely a tall kid in China. LeBron James was about 3 years old and probably had received only 15 recruiting letters. Oklahoma City was a gas station. The All-Star Game was only then becoming a Weekend. Seven years later, for reasons too complicated to explain here, I was in Qatar, covering the Asian Zone qualifying round for the World Cup. This was old Qatar, before we turned it into an aircraft carrier. I wandered into a sporting goods souk, looking to buy a jersey or two from one of the competing teams. (And what a field it was: Saudi Arabia, Japan, North and South Korea, Iran, and Iraq. Traditional rivals!)</p>
<p>Anyway, the nice Qatari man behind the counter was very sad. No, he told me, we have nothing like that. But then his face brightened. Hey, I was American! He reached behind the counter. “Look,” he said. “We have Michael Jordan!”</p>
<p>That’s what the NBA became while David Stern was its commissioner. It became the giant, gleaming, diamond-tipped drill bit of market penetration.</p>
<p>Now, as Stern leaves after 30 years on the job, there is a natural tendency to treat him as though he were some complicated hybrid of Henry Ford, Don Draper, and Rick Rubin: the man who invented and sold an entirely new product that crossed national and cultural barriers to mainstream a new kind of sports-entertainment complex wah-dee-doo-dah. Much of that is true, but it’s only half the story. For one thing, the narrative leaves out (and indeed, positively minimizes) the efforts of Larry O’Brien and Larry Fleisher — two men who really arranged that David Stern would still have an NBA to market. So we will begin there, with O’Brien and Fleisher, two guys at whom nobody ever threw pizzas, because, when they set to work, nobody cared enough about the NBA to try.</p>

<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/stern-glasses-sl-features.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-99079" alt="Stern-Glasses-SL-Features" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/stern-glasses-sl-features.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=576" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>In 1980, the NBA was something between a cult object and a burlesque act. Those of us who still followed the league did so with bags over our heads to hide our rueful grins. (Let it be said. I loved those late-1970s Seattle teams, and it was fun to watch Julius Erving come into the league and blow everybody’s mind.) The argument that the NBA was “too black” to market itself was seriously made by serious people in an age when an organized backlash against the achievements of the civil rights movement was asserting itself, as we saw <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/495961/Bakke-decision" target="_blank">in the courtroom</a> and in <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/the_racism_at_the_heart_of_the_reagan_presidency/" target="_blank">coded language</a>. The argument that the NBA was a “drug league” — which was really a variation on the former contention — was seriously made by serious people in an age when the “war” on drugs was gathering itself. More to the point, and partly because of these problems, the league was broke and floundering, its championship series famously being played on tape delay.</p>
<p>The commissioner at the time was Larry O’Brien and, in the rush to canonize David Stern, there has been an unfortunate tendency to treat O’Brien as though he were kind of an amiable lightweight in a job that was too big for him. This is, of course, nonsense. O’Brien was a deep-game player his entire life, a crucial member of John Kennedy’s New Frontier brain trust, and he helped wrangle the 1964 Civil Rights Act through Congress on behalf of Lyndon Johnson. Hell, in June of 1972, it was Larry O’Brien’s phone that Howard Hunt sent his burglars back into the Watergate office complex to tap. If O’Brien hadn’t been sharp, he wouldn’t have signed up as his executive vice-president in 1980 a shark of a New York lawyer named David Stern.</p>
<p>The director of the National Basketball Players Association at the time was Larry Fleisher, and 30 years ago he did a remarkable thing. He managed to get the NBA to show its players&#8217; union the real books — which terrified everyone — and then he sold his union on the notion that cooperation with management was the only way to guarantee players would have a job in five years. And this was in an era in which football’s union was bargaining away any chance at real free agency, and baseball’s labor-management paradigm had begun to develop the resemblance to <i>Game of Thrones</i> that persists to this day. Working with Stern, but under the aegis of O’Brien, Fleisher helped develop and sold to his membership a salary cap, which was unheard of at the time. Stern did a marvelous job growing the league, but there were many hands involved in saving it, and we haven’t even mentioned Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, who came along at exactly the right time, and who helped turn Stern into a genius.</p>

<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/bird-stern-sl-features.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-99082" alt="Bird-Stern-SL-Features" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/bird-stern-sl-features.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=576" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>So, handed a remarkable turn of fortune that he helped engineer, what did David Stern do? Well, he grew the brand, as the marketing people say, and he grew it astonishingly well. The value of the franchises has increased tenfold. There are four television networks broadcasting NBA games worldwide. He has managed to stay ahead of the curve technologically, moving the league into the digital age more smoothly than was the case with many other American industries. The players make gobs of money. David Stern’s work here is done.</p>
<p>However, it has come at a price. By marrying the NBA to its “corporate partners,” and by doing it so thoroughly and so well, Stern has cost the league much of its soul, in the fullest meaning of the word. Both the 1998 and the 2011 lockouts were stupid and unnecessary and seemed more than a little like they were more about control and the authority of Stern’s office than they were about money or anything else. (In 2011, Stern gave preposterous interviews in which, channeling his inner Bud Selig, he <a href="http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/15/league-says-22-teams-to-lose-money-300-million-total-this-season/" target="_blank">maintained that 22 NBA teams were losing money</a>, which, I guarantee you, was not something he was telling his corporate partners, or his good friends over in China. This wasn’t Larry O’Brien and Larry Fleisher operating in rare good faith.) He presided over — and indeed, celebrated — the unconscionable hijacking of a franchise from one of the NBA’s most loyal fan bases in Seattle because the city wouldn’t give in to ensemble blackmail and build the team a new arena. The specter of the days when the NBA was thought to be “too black” never has been far from his decision to knuckle Allen Iverson about rap music and to create and enforce a silly dress code that was applauded by great swaths of the nation’s boring people, and to make a buck off the softer side of hip-hop culture while remaining terrified of its tougher precincts.</p>
<p>There is an essential cowardice in all authoritarians, which becomes more obvious as they tighten their grip. In the long view, it’s hard not to come to the conclusion that the more the NBA prospered, and the more tightly it bound itself to the corporate money that swarmed on that success like bugs on honey, the more nervous it got about how wealthy it had become. The more luxurious the palace, the deeper the moat. And David Stern’s primary job over the past two decades has been to dig the moat. He has been the vehicle of the deep insecurity that has come with the NBA’s headlong success.</p>
<p>He has made the league gleam, but he has sanded off its edges, and let that be his legacy. He made a product that people will buy. He has sold the NBA in Qatar, and the guy behind the counter was happy, and so there’s that, and nobody throws pizzas at David Stern anymore, just roses by the handful.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=98552&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
