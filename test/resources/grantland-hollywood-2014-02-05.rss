		<description><![CDATA[Flea hit the Peppers' site to issue a lengthy explanation that could've been condensed to "Jersey is cold in January and the NFL needs to know stuff will sound good when 112 million people are watching." Anthony Kiedis's vocals were live, but the band mimed "Give It Away" along to a new studio recording jammed "from our hearts [and] very like in spirit to the versions we have been playing live the last few years."<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100471&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ap803852527445-e1391607497322.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-100506" alt="Flea, Anthony Kiedis" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ap803852527445-e1391607497322.jpg?w=658&#038;h=371"   /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;That guitar is plugged into NOTHING,&#8221; Living Colour&#8217;s Vernon Reid <a href="https://twitter.com/vurnt22/status/430148392900366337" target="_blank">tweeted</a> during the Super Bowl <a href="http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-bruno-mars-super-bowl-halftime-show-a-stardom-level-scorecard/" target="_blank">halftime show</a>, throwing the Red Hot Chili Peppers into a steaming pot of awkwardness. Not for long, though, as bassist Flea hit the Peppers&#8217; site <a href="http://redhotchilipeppers.com/news/454-a-message-from-flea" target="_blank">to issue a lengthy explanation</a> that could&#8217;ve been condensed to &#8220;Jersey is cold in January, and the NFL needs to know stuff will sound good when 112 million people are watching.&#8221; Anthony Kiedis&#8217;s vocals were live, but the band mimed &#8220;Give It Away&#8221; along to a new studio recording jammed &#8220;from our hearts [and] very like in spirit to the versions we have been playing live the last few years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flea adds that there wasn&#8217;t &#8220;any room for argument on this, the NFL does not want to risk their show being botched by bad sound, period.&#8221; He goes on to recount the Chili Peppers&#8217; decades of refusing fakey performances:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The last time we did it (or tried to) was in the late &#8217;80s, we were thrown off of <em>The Top of the Pops</em> television program in the U.K. during rehearsals because we refused to mime properly, I played bass with my shoe, John played guitar atop Anthony&#8217;s shoulders, and we basically had a wrestling match onstage, making a mockery of the idea that it was a real live performance. … We take our music playing seriously, it is a sacred thing for us, and anyone who has ever seen us in concert (like the night before the Super Bowl at the Barclays Center), knows that we play from our heart, we improvise spontaneously, take musical risks, and sweat blood <em>[Editor's note: !!]</em> at every show. We have been on the road for 31 years doing it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of the deal-sealer for the band was that they&#8217;re all football fans. It also couldn&#8217;t have hurt that the Chili Peppers got to appear in the middle of the year&#8217;s biggest television event, alongside a successful star 25 years their junior. &#8220;We had given this a lot of thought before agreeing to do it,&#8221; Flea writes, &#8220;and besides many a long conversation amongst ourselves, I spoke with many musician friends for whom I have the utmost respect, and they all said they would do it if asked, that it was a wild trippy thing to do, what the hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why not at least <em>pretend</em> to be plugged in, though? Did you really have to take Vernon Reid out of the moment like that, guys? “It seemed like the realest thing to do in the circumstance. It was like making a music video in front of a gazillion people, except with live vocals, and only one chance to rock it. Our only thought was to bring the spirit of who we are to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>No word about Bruno Mars&#8217;s band yet. Stay tuned. You know people are on the case.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100471&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Also in the Afternoon Links: Netflix renews <em>House of Cards</em> for a third season, Jerry Seinfeld gets testy, Action Bronson gets pushy, and Nas gets anniversary-y.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100361&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-100398" alt="19th Annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards - Arrivals" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hp_getty_leojonah_655.jpg?w=658"   /></p>
<p><strong>Remember Richard Jewell,</strong> the security guard at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta who found a bomb in a bag and cleared the area, resulting in two deaths and 111 injuries instead of many, many more? The guy about whom ESPN just made <a href="http://grantland.com/features/30-for-30-shorts-judging-jewell/" target="_blank">a 30 for 30 short</a>? Jonah Hill&#8217;s <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/richard-jewell-movie-jonah-hill-leonardo-dicaprio-fox/" target="_blank">going to play him in a movie</a>, and he&#8217;s going to act alongside his <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> costar/<a href="http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/snl-jonah-hill-takes-flight-in-the-arms-of-his-buddy-leo/" target="_blank"><em>Titanic</em> re-creator</a> Leonardo DiCaprio. Per Deadline, Leo will play &#8220;a Southern attorney who mostly did real estate closings and seemed in over his head, but [who] guided Jewell through a hellish <em>Twilight Zone</em> that went on even after the FBI officially cleared Jewell’s name three months later.&#8221; That&#8217;s right — &#8220;cleared his name.&#8221; Because after his act of courage, Jewell quickly found himself under the magnifying glass as a suspect. This is going to be a heavy movie. Hill and DiCaprio will both produce, although there&#8217;s no info about who&#8217;s writing or directing yet.</p>
<p><strong>Netflix</strong> has <a href="http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/netflix-orders-house-of-cards-third-season-1201086001/" target="_blank">ordered its third season of <em>House of Cards</em></a>, 10 days before Season 2 premieres. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are onboard; Frank Underwood will be president of the world by the end.</p>
<p><em><strong>Billy on the Street</strong></em> <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/see-a-trailer-for-billy-on-the-streets-season-3.html" target="_blank">is coming back soon</a>, too! So many good newses!</p>
<p><em><strong>The Walking Dead’</strong></em><strong>s</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>Norman Reedus says all the last episodes of this season — all EIGHT of them — <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/02/04/walking-dead-norman-reedus-daryl-dixon-best/" target="_blank">are the show&#8217;s best yet</a>. Hmm — guess we&#8217;ll see. (Also, Lauren Cohan, who plays Maggie, is set to <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/02/04/archer-lauren-cohan-walking-dead/" target="_blank">visit </a><em><a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/02/04/archer-lauren-cohan-walking-dead/" target="_blank">Archer</a></em><em> </em>for a few episodes.)</p>
<p><strong>When Action Bronson</strong> wants to smoke weed <a href="http://grantland.com/features/a-week-action-bronson/" target="_blank">for a Grantland profile</a>, everything&#8217;s cool. But when he <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/5893930/action-bronson-smokes-weed-onstage-shoves-security-guard" target="_blank">tries to do it onstage in Portland</a>? DISASTER.</p>

<p><strong>Ask Jerry Seinfeld</strong> why <em>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</em> features basically all white males as guests <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/whats-the-deal-with-jerry-seinfelds-racial-diversity-answer/" target="_blank">and he&#8217;ll say</a>: &#8221;This really pisses me off … People think it’s the census or something. This has gotta represent the actual pie chart of America? Who cares? It&#8217;s just funny. Funny is the world that I live in. You’re funny, I’m interested. You’re not funny, I’m not interested. I have no interest in gender or race or anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Justin Bieber</strong> will <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/02/04/justin-bieber-homeland-security-u-s-customs-searched-flying/" target="_blank">never have an easy time</a> at Customs now.</p>
<p><strong>Look, I don&#8217;t</strong> want to have to waste your time on pregnancy rumors.

<p><strong><em>Thor: The Dark World’</em>s</strong> gag reel is better than you might expect. [<a href="http://popculturebrain.com/post/75608923656/hiddleston-daily-thor-the-dark-world-full" target="_blank">via</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Zooey Deschanel</strong> is now producing a &#8220;<a href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/zooey-deschanel-producing-animated-modern-fairytale-comedy-project-for-fox" target="_blank">workplace comedy set in a modern fairytale world</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Contrary</strong> to earlier reports, Laura Prepon will appear <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/laura-prepon-returning-for-most-of-orange-is-the-new-blacks-second-season-creator-jenji-kohan-says-201432" target="_blank">in most of <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>&#8216;s second season</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-100405" alt="facebook_rem" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/facebook_rem.jpg?w=658"   /></p>
<p>It was the defining moment of my near-decade on Facebook. And on this, the 10th birthday of the social networking platform, it seems appropriate to take a look back at this point in history.</p>
<p>The day one of your parents joined Facebook.</p>
<p>Chances are that you spent years on Facebook without a chaperone. I had almost five years. And not five calm, mature years — the summer before freshman year of college through my first year as a post-collegiate &#8220;adult&#8221; in New York City.</p>
<p>If there was ever a time to not document every moment of your life, it&#8217;s that exact stretch. But it was done. All of it. And during that time, Facebook and I grew up together and grew on each other.</p>
<p>And then, in 2010, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAFZnvTfFAs" target="_blank">FLEX BOMB</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-100360" alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-04 at 3.53.41 PM" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-04-at-3-53-41-pm.png?w=540&#038;h=58" width="540" height="58" /></p>
<p>What does that even mean? We&#8217;re &#8220;friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>My mom and I aren&#8217;t &#8220;friends.&#8221; She&#8217;s my mom, I&#8217;m her son, and we&#8217;re the most important person in each other&#8217;s lives. But, as of May 2, 2010, we were friends on Facebook. [<em>Note: My friend Mom is not my "mother" on Facebook, just my friend.</em>]</p>
<p>The next day, after my mother became my friend, I communicated publicly with my friend Mom, via her Wall.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-04 at 2.54.30 PM" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-04-at-2-54-30-pm.png?w=576&#038;h=220" width="576" height="220" /></p>
<p>But she did not get out. And while I understand that she signed up only to &#8220;get in contact with people for her high school reunion,&#8221; that event took place two years ago and she&#8217;s still on Facebook.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a trap, one not even my beautiful, intelligent, dignified mother could avoid.</p>
<p>Over time, I&#8217;ve grown to appreciate her presence, as a way for her to keep up with the reputable things I&#8217;m doing. But there&#8217;s still a great deal of <em>does-not-compute-mailer-daemon-one-divided-by-zero</em> when considering your mother on Facebook.</p>
<p>For instance, my mother and I currently have 24 mutual friends on Facebook. Again, what does that even mean, the idea of us having &#8220;mutual friends&#8221;? Mutual friends are like, &#8220;Oh, you work with Tim, that&#8217;s trés cray, he was on my freshman floor, how is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>My mom and I don&#8217;t have any of those. Because she&#8217;s my mom. We&#8217;re &#8220;related.&#8221; We&#8217;re <i>so </i>related, in fact, that I&#8217;m not here without her. Yes, some of my friends for whom she&#8217;s made grits and eggs and biscuits over the years are friends with her on Facebook, and some of her high school classmates who remember me as a 3-year-old have requested my friendship, but these aren&#8217;t &#8220;mutual friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>But here we are. Twenty-four and counting.</p>
<p>Another oddity: Facebook asking if I&#8217;d like to &#8220;see our friendship.&#8221; Or if I&#8217;d like to tell the story of &#8220;how we met.&#8221;</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t &#8220;meet.&#8221; I &#8220;happened.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the story of how I happened, however, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re really asking, Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-04-at-4-18-12-pm.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-100369" alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-04 at 4.18.12 PM" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-04-at-4-18-12-pm.png?w=540&#038;h=304" width="540" height="304" /></a></p>
<p>Facebook is weird. But it made it to its 10th birthday, and that&#8217;s a milestone that deserves a blue thumbs-up. And, as much as I hate to admit it, it&#8217;s made my relationship with my mother better. You have no idea how much I hate admitting it, but it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>But we aren&#8217;t friends. I mean, we are friends. On Facebook. But in real life, calling my mother a— <em>never mind.</em></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100347&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Woody Allen has been nominated for Best Original Screenplay this year for <i>Blue Jasmine</i>, his 16th nod in the category. He&#8217;s been nominated for the award more than any other writer in the history of the Oscars, and has won three times, for <i>Annie Hall</i>, <i>Hannah and Her Sisters</i>, and <i>Midnight in Paris</i>. Allen is 78 years old. His adopted daughter Dylan Farrow is 28. On February 1 she posted a long, poignantly written <a href="http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/" target="_blank">open letter to Allen</a> on the <i>New York Times</i> website saying that Allen molested her in the family&#8217;s attic when she was 7 years old. The molestation accusations are not new; they first surfaced in 1992. But Dylan Farrow had not spoken about it on the record publicly until last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/11/mia-farrow-frank-sinatra-ronan-farrow" target="_blank"><i>Vanity Fair</i> profile of Mia Farrow</a> by Maureen Orth, and this is the first time she has ever written about it. The letter is concise and harrowing. She addresses Allen&#8217;s collaborators, asking them point-blank how they would feel if Allen had molested their children. She asks of the woman who delivered Allen&#8217;s Cecil B. DeMille Award: &#8220;You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?&#8221;</p>
<p>What is the reputation of a great artist worth? It&#8217;s a question that has come up a lot recently, bringing with it a bunch of other existential questions, the kind that might be debated in a Woody Allen movie. Is the value of art ever not subjective? Should a person&#8217;s personal life affect how you feel about their work? Can we really separate the art from the artist? R. Kelly&#8217;s most recent album and the accompanying wave of critical praise surrounding it spurred Jessica Hopper to publish <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/12/read_the_stomac.php" target="_blank">a Q&amp;A in the <i>Village Voice</i></a> with Jim DeRogatis that detailed DeRogatis&#8217;s reporting on the sexual abuse allegations against Kelly from 15 years ago. But although Kelly was reevaluated, with music writers vowing to think twice before they gave him another rave, people seem less eager to denounce Allen. This seemed pretty racist to me. After all, the indie rock world&#8217;s romance with Kelly had always been fraught with a lot of weird tension about race, with Kelly uncomfortably painted by the white music press as a genius buffoon. I believe that R. Kelly is every bit as much of an artistic genius as Woody Allen, that his longevity on the charts belies a masterful understanding of music, structure, and yeah, lyrics. I also think he is a sexual predator and a monster. It is disgusting that he got off in 2008 using the <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/statusainthood/2008/06/on_the_r_kelly.php" target="_blank">&#8220;<em>Little Man</em> defense&#8221;</a> to discredit a 27-minute sex tape that clearly showed him peeing on a 14-year-old victim. The jurors blamed &#8220;a lack of evidence.&#8221; Stories about Kelly&#8217;s history of behavior are not hard to come by. He&#8217;s known to hang out at Chicago high schools to pick up girls.</p>
<p>Public reaction to the Dylan Farrow story has been split along battle lines. Allen&#8217;s defenders believe that Dylan Farrow is lying and was coached by Mia Farrow at age 7 to tell a story about how Allen molested her to damage him and throw favor toward Mia in their contentious custody battle. Following that line of logic, Dylan has kept up this lie for 21 years, but may not even know she is lying because Mia somehow &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; her and implanted this false memory. If you believe Dylan, she was molested by her adoptive father figure when she was a young child after a series of escalating incidents in which he pushed the boundaries of her comfort with his physicality. Dylan writes: &#8220;He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother&#8217;s electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising we&#8217;d go to Paris and I&#8217;d be a star in his movies. I remember staring at that toy train, focusing on it as it traveled in its circle around the attic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mqyS36-n7U" target="_blank">denies any of this happened</a>. Dylan stands by her childhood memory, with all its specifics and details. There is something about the Woody Allen case that seems to make some people recoil, as if the very idea is so distasteful it shouldn&#8217;t even be discussed. To Dylan Farrow, &#8220;Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse.&#8221; She asks us to &#8220;imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter,&#8221; her bleak joke being that of course that world exists, and she lives there.</p>
<p>In the 2013 <i>Vanity Fair</i> article, Farrow describes a time in college when a student wearing a shirt with Allen&#8217;s face on it prompted her to start violently throwing up. Allen has never been convicted of anything, nor has he ever been charged. In 1993 the Yale–New Haven Hospital Child Sexual Abuse Clinic reached the opinion that Dylan Farrow had not been abused, but during the trial later that year where Allen tried to gain custody of his children back from Mia Farrow, the Yale–New Haven doctors <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/culturebox/2014/01/did_woody_allen_molest_his_adopted_daughter_22_years_ago_reviewing_the_evidence.html" target="_blank">could not produce the case’s notes for the court</a>.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with Allen&#8217;s relationship with Dylan attested to Maureen Orth in 1992 that Allen was <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1992/11/farrow199211" target="_blank">“completely obsessed”</a> with Farrow&#8217;s adopted daughter. He &#8220;would monopolize her totally, to the exclusion of her brothers and sisters, and spend hours whispering to her.&#8221; Was it normal fatherly affection or something more sinister? Allen had exhibited <a href="http://www.leagle.com/decision/1994524197AD2d327_1461" target="_blank">“abnormally intense”</a> interest in Dylan, according to the appellate court opinion in the custody trial Allen had brought against Mia Farrow. Allen&#8217;s legal team&#8217;s timeline purported that the accusations about Dylan were a direct result of Mia finding out about Woody&#8217;s affair with Mia&#8217;s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, but their timeline is contradictory with Mia&#8217;s. According to Orth, Allen was already in therapy for his behavior toward Dylan before Mia found nude photos he had taken of Previn, who was 21 to Allen&#8217;s 56 at the time. When Allen was confronted about the pictures, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-23/news/mn-7319_1_woody-allen" target="_blank">Allen said</a> it was because &#8220;Previn had talked about becoming a model&#8221; and asked him to take pictures of her.</p>
<p>Orth says sources told her that Allen openly preferred Dylan to any of the other children in the Allen-Farrow household. Friends noticed how &#8220;Woody, wearing just underwear, would take Dylan to bed with him and entwine his body around hers; or that he would have her suck his thumb; or that often when Dylan went over to his apartment he would head straight for the bedroom with her so they could get into bed and play.&#8221; The first alarm was sounded by Mia&#8217;s mother, Maureen O&#8217;Sullivan, and sister Tisa Farrow, who <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1992/11/farrow199211" target="_blank">found some of Allen&#8217;s behavior suspicious</a>.</p>
<p>Allen&#8217;s team has consistently pushed the idea that Mia Farrow is acting out of jealousy and some kind of scary womanly rage. The push to make Mia Farrow seem irrational is eerily reminiscent of what her character goes through in <i>Rosemary&#8217;s Baby</i>. Dylan Farrow lives in a world where people have consistently told her that her experiences didn&#8217;t happen, that her own memories don&#8217;t count. It&#8217;s what the system told her when she was 7, and now it&#8217;s what Allen&#8217;s defenders are doing again. Allen denied he had ever abused Dylan, and claimed it was part of a smear campaign meant to make him look like an all-around deviant pervert after Mia found out he&#8217;d been taking naked photos of Soon-Yi. Granted, lusting after his partner&#8217;s adopted daughter was already making Woody look like a deviant pervert. But his reputation survived, and the public chose to sweep it under the rug for another two decades, until the <i>Vanity Fair</i> profile of Mia dredged it up again.</p>
<p>At the Golden Globes, Allen was given an honorary award. He didn&#8217;t show up, but Diane Keaton gave him a long, loving tribute and sang a maudlin little song. It&#8217;s the sort of thing that would normally seem charming, but in the moment suddenly felt only sinister. Hollywood has a long history of protecting powerful men from the consequences of their own bad behavior. Three out of Charlie Chaplin&#8217;s four wives were teenagers when they wed: a 16-year-old (Mildred Harris), a different 16-year-old (Lita Grey), and a 17-year-old (Oona O&#8217;Neill). According to his friend Harry Crocker, Chaplin <a href="http://www.chaplinalife.com/photo_essays/06.html" target="_blank">preferred teens</a> because they are &#8220;so feminine at that age — so wholly, girlishly young.&#8221; Roman Polanski <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/victim-or-perpetrator-the-tragic-case-of-roman-polanski-a-653586-3.html" target="_blank">has never expressed remorse</a> about raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977, and the judge in his trial noted that his victim was &#8220;sexually experienced&#8221; and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/movies/11polanski.html" target="_blank">&#8220;looked older than her years.&#8221;</a> (Mia Farrow recently <a href="https://twitter.com/MiaFarrow/statuses/430053378107142144" target="_blank">refuted the rumor</a> that she is friends with Polanski, as though that would make the charges against Allen too hypocritical to stand.)</p>
<p>Last week the Daily Beast published a piece by Robert B. Weide titled <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/27/the-woody-allen-allegations-not-so-fast.html" target="_blank">&#8220;The Woody Allen Allegations: Not So Fast.&#8221;</a> Weide defended Allen based on his own interactions with him, painted Mia Farrow as unstable, and publicly revealed Dylan Farrow&#8217;s new name. &#8220;Not So Fast&#8221; seemed like an especially ridiculous headline because it had taken more than two decades for the allegations of Allen&#8217;s child molestation to be discussed openly again. Weide&#8217;s article was tone-deaf in a number of ways. Whether Mia Farrow has her own psychological issues has nothing to do with Dylan&#8217;s credibility. Dylan can speak for herself. Defending someone accused of a heinous crime with the platform &#8220;He&#8217;s always been cool to me!&#8221; is not an effective argument. Abusers don&#8217;t abuse everyone in sight, nor do they necessarily pick the most obvious targets. Abuse of power is extremely complex.</p>
<p>Hollywood&#8217;s obsession with youth often extends in particular to its female stars, who are cast by overwhelmingly male directors. On average, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/01/30/hollywood-women-pay-salary-men/5050433/" target="_blank">actresses&#8217; salaries</a> peak when they are 34, while male movie stars do not make their highest salary until age 51. This has been a constant in Hollywood for so long it seems invisible sometimes, but its obviousness is important. The men get to keep getting older; the women have to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wf-mRo7C2I" target="_blank">stay the same age</a>. One of the reasons people have so vehemently denied the Woody Allen charges is that Allen has always been praised as a man who writes great roles for women. It doesn&#8217;t compute — he respects women, doesn&#8217;t he? He&#8217;s not the kind of gross creep who just casts variations of the same hot young blonde over and over, right? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Then-Again-Diane-Keaton/dp/0812980956" target="_blank">Then again</a>, weren&#8217;t we not supposed to conflate art and artist?</p>
<p>The exceptions to the rule about actresses are touted as though they are symbolic of the whole industry, but even Meryl Streep knows she is a token. Streep played one of Woody&#8217;s indelible intellectual women in <i>Manhattan</i>, but she is not among his defenders. In 1980, she told <i>Ladies&#8217; Home Journal</i>, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Woody Allen even remembers me. I went to see <i>Manhattan</i> and I felt like I wasn&#8217;t even in it. I was pleased with the film because I looked pretty in it and I thought it was entertaining. But I only worked on the film for three days and I didn&#8217;t get to know Woody. Who gets to know Woody? He&#8217;s very much a womanizer; very self-involved. On a certain level, the film offends me because it&#8217;s all about these people whose sole concern is discussing their emotional states or their neuroses. It&#8217;s sad because Woody has the potential to be America&#8217;s Chekhov. But instead, he&#8217;s still caught up in the jet-set crowd type of life, trivializing his talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>By now, Allen&#8217;s cinematic reputation is burnished in gold. Even another <i>The Curse of the Jade Scorpion</i> could not undo the praise heaped on the perfectly adequate <i>Midnight in Paris</i>. Allen&#8217;s influence is baked into so much of pop culture. His movies are such a formative influence on American independent film. It&#8217;s not surprising people are taking the allegations so hard or so personally. They are worried that their entire postadolescent character has sprouted from a rotten seed. Imagine hearing someone say that your lovable, respected, hilarious relative whom you have always heroized is actually a child molester.</p>
<p>How you feel about Woody Allen&#8217;s work is up to you. Nobody is going to guilt you if you continue to <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1979/aug/16/letter-from-manhattan/" target="_blank">love <em>Manhattan</em></a>. But let&#8217;s not pretend that the allegations against Woody are completely implausible for the sake of preserving our own innocence about a beloved artist whom millions of people consider their favorite director. Whether you believe Dylan Farrow or Allen, it&#8217;s not in poor taste to air it out in public. There is not even new information here. Just new angles on old information, filled in with more detail by Dylan herself. Her letter is extremely specific in its detail. There is nothing erotic about it. She is describing a torture scene.</p>
<p>These are serious allegations and they should absolutely be taken seriously. I&#8217;m not sure what Dylan Farrow has to gain from speaking up in this situation other than peace of mind. It&#8217;s not about money, or taking down the empire of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Man_theory" target="_blank">Great Man</a>. It&#8217;s about power imbalances between adults and children, old men and young women, men and women in general. It&#8217;s about whose voice gets listened to in a conversation, whose experience is considered more valid and why. “I know it’s ‘he said, she said,’” Dylan told the <i>New York Times</i>&#8216; Nicholas Kristof. “But, to me, it’s black and white, because I was there.” She wants to inspire sexual assault victims to come forward. “I was thinking, if I don’t speak out, I’ll regret it on my death bed.” Ultimately it really is just &#8220;he said, she said&#8221; and you can believe what you want to believe. The Mariel Hemingway character arc in <i>Manhattan</i> isn&#8217;t evidence. Neither are the guys who commit murders and get away with it in <i>Crimes and Misdemeanors</i> or <i>Match Point</i>. If you believe Dylan Farrow, you believe she is describing exactly what happened to her.</p>
<p>Two of Allen&#8217;s associates <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/02/dylan-farrow-woody-allen-open-letter-nytimes-sexual-abuse" target="_blank">have made statements</a> in response to Farrow&#8217;s open letter. Allen&#8217;s attorney Elkan Abramowitz writes: &#8220;It is tragic that after 20 years a story engineered by a vengeful lover resurfaces after it was fully vetted and rejected by independent authorities. The one to blame for Dylan&#8217;s distress is neither Dylan nor Woody Allen.&#8221; Meanwhile, publicist Leslee Dart stated that &#8220;Mr. Allen has read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful. He will be responding very soon … At the time, a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts. The experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation; that Dylan Farrow had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality; and that Dylan Farrow had likely been coached by her mother Mia Farrow. No charges were ever filed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tuesday morning, <a href="http://www.today.com/entertainment/woody-allens-lawyer-dylan-farrows-molestation-memories-implanted-her-mother-2D12054179" target="_blank">Abramowitz told <i>Today</i></a> that Allen&#8217;s &#8220;reaction is one of overwhelming sadness because of what has happened to Dylan.&#8221; What happened to Dylan, according to Allen&#8217;s lawyer, is that she was coached by Mia into believing she was abused by Allen. Abramowitz claims Dylan doesn&#8217;t realize that &#8220;the idea that she was molested was implanted in her by her mother. That memory is never going to go away.&#8221; How exactly Mia could have &#8220;implanted&#8221; such a vivid memory in her daughter&#8217;s mind is not explained. Abramowitz goes on to say that Dylan is confused. &#8220;In my view, she&#8217;s not lying. I think she truly believes this happened. That&#8217;s what the vice of this is. When you implant a story in a fragile 7-year-old&#8217;s mind, it stays there forever. It never goes away.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few hours before Abramowitz&#8217;s appearance on <i>Today</i>, Mia Farrow released her own statement, <a href="https://twitter.com/MiaFarrow/statuses/430586962068926464" target="_blank">via Twitter</a>: &#8220;I love my daughter. I will always protect her. A lot of ugliness is going to be aimed at me. But this is not about me. It&#8217;s about her truth.&#8221; Abramowitz also told <i>Today</i> that Allen won&#8217;t be suing Dylan for defamation, and that the molestation case has been closed for 20 years. &#8220;The case is over. There is no case. The fact that it is being brought up now is suspect. The timing is suspect.&#8221; Because it&#8217;s all a conspiracy to bring down Allen&#8217;s chances at another Oscar? According to Abramowitz, that&#8217;s part of it. &#8220;I think that it&#8217;s a continuation of Mia Farrow&#8217;s desire to hurt Woody Allen. And Woody Allen is now riding fairly high. He got the Golden Globe for lifetime achievement, which he totally deserved. And I believe it revived the anger that she has toward him.&#8221; But Dylan Farrow is not a child, she is a grown woman whose intentions cannot be conflated with her mother&#8217;s. And no matter how awards seasons plays out, this story is not going to go away.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=99603&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[This week, a little flurry of ‘SNL’-related articles feeds our never-ending hunger. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100212&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-100314" alt="HP_getty_SNL1976_655" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hp_getty_snl1976_655.jpg?w=658"   /></p>
<p>If there&#8217;s been a show more closely documented in television history than <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, I can&#8217;t think of what it is. The two primary reference tomes — Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller&#8217;s oral history <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Live-From-New-York-Uncensored/dp/0316735655" target="_blank"><em>Live From New York</em></a>, and Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saturday-Night-Backstage-History-Live/dp/0688050999" target="_blank"><em>Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live</em></a> — cover plenty of ground just between the two of them: We learn all about the fraught beginnings, the coke-fueled early days, and the constant struggle to put on a good show. Then there&#8217;s the cottage industry of memoirs from ex-<em>SNL</em>ers: That includes Darrell Hammond&#8217;s <em>God, If You’re Not Up There, I’m F*cked</em>, Tom Davis&#8217;s <em>Thirty-Nine Years of Short-Term Memory Loss: The Early Days of SNL From Someone Who Was There</em>, and even Jay Mohr&#8217;s <em>Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches at Saturday Night Live</em>. (Tina Fey&#8217;s and Steve Martin&#8217;s beloved memoirs aren&#8217;t as explicitly one-track-minded, but still touch on the show.) Meanwhile, the media continues to scrutinize every lurch, stumble, and step the show takes as closely as ever. You&#8217;d think, by now, that we knew everything we ever wanted to know about <em>SNL</em>. And you&#8217;d think wrong!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s in part <em>because</em> we know so much: We&#8217;re so familiar with the old stories that we just can&#8217;t help but be curious as to how the new ones stack up. But it&#8217;s also because the show is just naturally dramatic: It&#8217;s constantly on the verge of falling apart, and constantly birthing arguments; it takes unknowns and makes them our favorite actors more regularly than anywhere else in entertainment; and, at its best, it continues to function as a telling cross-section of American culture. When the aliens land, you could do worse than to show them <em>SNL</em> — and then wait for them to tell you, using their wordless advanced-civilization mind control, that it&#8217;s not as funny as it used to be.</p>
<p>This week, we got ourselves a little flurry of <em>SNL</em>-related articles to feed our never-ending hunger, including <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-interview.html" target="_blank"><em>New York</em> magazine&#8217;s profile of Jimmy Fallon</a> and <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/lorne-michaels-on-tonight-show-snl.html" target="_blank">its long interview with Lorne Michaels</a>, plus a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/fashion/SNL-Saturday-Night-Live-Lorne-Michaels-after-party.html" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> piece on the state of the elusive <em>SNL</em> after-party</a>. So, what did we learn?</p>
<p><strong>1. Things Done Changed:</strong> Ever since Belushi and Aykroyd took over a downtown dive and refashioned it as the Blues Bar — their very own postshow den of sin where, as the <em>Times</em> explains, &#8220;on a given night, Keith Richards, James Taylor or Sam Moore might be jamming with Mr. Belushi and Mr. Aykroyd’s Stink Band&#8221; — <em>SNL</em> after-parties have had a touch of the forbidden to them. But venturing into the modern crop, the <em>Times</em> sees nothing too batty: &#8220;Buddakan, an upstairs-downstairs place that conveys all the hail-fellow-well-met of an Italianate spec mansion, never made it to kooky, much less crazy. They could have used another bartender upstairs. Madonna didn’t show. Penny Marshall was there, if that helps, as were Chris Rock and other comedians like Judah Friedlander and Eugene Mirman.&#8221; And then, tragically enough: &#8220;Oddly, the most resonant image of the night … was Seth Meyers … at last call, head bent and undoubtedly exhausted, signing his bill.&#8221; That&#8217;s right: The booze. Is not. <em>Free.</em></p>
<p><strong>2. But Then Again, Maybe They Haven&#8217;t:</strong> Rachel Dratch, during her early-2000s run with the show, didn&#8217;t see much insanity: &#8220;When you first get on the show, you’re so thrilled, the party is like another part of the whole Cinderella vibe of the whole thing. You’re not like, ‘What’s up with this party?’ … As the years go on, you know what they entail. It’s still such a ritual. I always went to the party. I didn’t miss one party.&#8221; But going way further back, original cast member Laraine Newman cuts down even the Blues Bar&#8217;s infamous debauchery: &#8220;Pretty soon, I avoided them and I think many others did too … Although we needed to unwind, there was another kind of pressure at that party that became, well … work, networking.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Horatio Sanz Was Always Ready to Rage:</strong> Maybe Laraine and Rachel could have gotten some kicks in with Horatio? As Sanz explained to the <em>Times</em>, the debauchery &#8220;was a part of the creative process in the beginning, and it’s been written about and talked about, and I kind of wanted to have the same thing for our generation.” That meant &#8220;securing a location in Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s New York City that would stay open past legal last-call hours and printing special tickets to be handed out to a more-select set at the after-party. Sometimes, Mr. Sanz said, especially on nights when a sketch of his was cut at dress rehearsal, he skipped the after-party altogether and rode around in his limo with half a case of beer, listening to music and waiting for his after-after to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanz, just letting it all go this week, explained a bit further to <em>New York</em>: “We were super-functioning alcoholics, definitely. They say that kind of goes hand in hand with SNL, some kind of substance-abuse issues, because it’s so stressful you easily find yourself blowing off steam a lot.” One specific anecdote: &#8220;Niagara in the East Village was [a] favorite bar; Sanz once demanded a ­margarita in the biggest glass the bar had, which turned out to be a vase, and woke up on the sidewalk in front of his apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>4. Jimmy Fallon Could Take You Down With His Mighty Fists of Drunken Rage:</strong> And now, possibly most important of all: It turns out that Jimmy Fallon, with a couple of pops in him, becomes an undefeatable Kimbo Slice of a man. As Sanz also told <em>New York</em>, “Yeah, we got in a couple of brawls. I’ve seen Jimmy clock a few people.” One time Fallon poured a beer on a guy&#8217;s hat, thinking the hat belonged to a friend of Sanz. “The owner of the hat, we didn’t know who he was, said something like, ‘What the fuck are you guys doing?’ and Jimmy just punched him. He wasn’t that hurt; he just walked into a tornado of drunken stupidity. Yeah, Jimmy could fight. I don’t know where he learned, but he definitely scrapped with the best of them.”</p>
<p>Jimmy Fallon, street fighting man. Who knew?</p>
<p><strong>5. Lorne&#8217;s Into Dinner:</strong> And in the midst of all that alleged-or-otherwise debauchery, what does Lorne Michaels do? Lorne Michaels eats food. Explaining his schedule to <em>New York</em>, Michaels goes deep on his most cherished meal of the day:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Monday we do [a] meeting, usually around 5 or 5:30 p.m … I’m generally either at home or at dinner by eight … Tuesday, around 8:30 p.m., I take the host to dinner … The sets start arriving on Thursday … Thursday night I get to have dinner.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Dinners seem important to you.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Friday, I have to get out, too.</p>
<p>Just making sure you understand all this correctly: On Friday nights, Lorne Michaels has dinner.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">&#8220;And then there were 11,&#8221; just as it was foretold by ancient seer Agatha Christie. Or was it Nostradamus? No matter. The introductory sentiment stands, and the instructors at the Bachelor School can&#8217;t waste their time on any history lesson that doesn&#8217;t materially affect one&#8217;s strategy. It is Week 5, and the field has narrowed considerably. If you have progressed this far along the petal-strewn Path to the Final Rose, you might take a moment, between restorative soaks in a heart-shaped whirlpool and unlimited refills of a buttery chardonnay, to notice that several chairs in the common area are empty, many sofa cushions unoccupied by rivals drinking in your life force through the sides of their evil eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">You have never been closer to ForeverLove. You can almost feel its warmth on your skin, like the rays of the sun peeking over the horizon in a foreign land whose name you&#8217;ve already forgotten. That also may be the chardonnay working its magic. The feelings are indistinguishable. We take our warmth where we can get it. The world is a cold and lonely place.</span></p>
<p>At this crucial juncture in the season, we pause from our usual, more general learning plan to offer a hyper-targeted lesson on perhaps the timeliest and most important question facing <em>Bachelor</em> contestants today:</p>
<p>Should you have sex in the ocean?</p>
<p>The answers may surprise you. Let&#8217;s learn.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#c4161c;">Yes, You Should Have Sex in the Ocean</span></h2>
<p>&#8220;Putting out&#8221; has always been a fundamental strategy for success on <em>The Bachelor</em>. At its core, the show has always been about one intellectually incurious man&#8217;s journey to test his physical compatibility with as many partners as possible before deciding upon one woman with whom to temporarily share his life, before the pressure of nagging tabloid covers and the dizzying world of post-fame sexual opportunity necessitates a reexamination of his commitment to his original choice. Every so often, this process will result in an actual marriage, but that&#8217;s more of an occasional side effect than the intended outcome. ForeverLove is a paradoxically fleeting thing. We, as a society of <em>Bachelor </em>watchers, have come to accept that. It is the foundation upon which the entire franchise is built.</p>
<p>Ah, but here we are mired in philosophy when we should be up to our thighs in the gently lapping waves of practicality. Let&#8217;s set the stage.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re on a group date in an exotic locale. Your earlier strategic decision to not have any close friends among your sister-contestants means that you&#8217;ve been able to secure the passenger seat in your Bachelor&#8217;s boat, as the others all have foolishly paired off and left you with some free one-on-one time. Your Bachelor even steers your bamboo conveyance temporarily out of sight so that he may steal a kiss. He can&#8217;t stop kissing you, arbitrarily applied no-<em>besito</em> rules be damned. Your chemistry cannot be denied, mashing-faces-together-at-every-possible-opportunity-wise.</p>
<p>He later invites you back to his suite for a dip in his private pool. There is more kissing. He invites you to sit on the beach, because your make-out demands a more dramatic vista. You are <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelor/news/kiss-leaderboard/140204-week-five" target="_blank">dominating the leaderboard</a>.  He is melting your inner ice queen.</p>
<p>Momentarily sated, he returns to the group, where he will have a series of unsatisfying encounters with women who demand his constant reassurance that he is developing feelings for them, that he&#8217;s still interested in &#8220;seeing where things go.&#8221; But it&#8217;s you he clearly can&#8217;t resist.</p>
<p>And so you steal off to his room at 4 a.m., rousing him from bed. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go for a swim,&#8221; you say, like it&#8217;s the most natural thing in the world. He accepts the invitation.</p>
<p>Moments later you are dancing in the surf. That chemistry takes over; you can no more deny it than you could stop the foamy explosion of a Mento dropped into a Diet Pepsi bottle. There are no cameras in the water; the vast expanse of the Pacific is now your Fantasy Suite.</p>
<p>So: Do you have sex in the ocean?</p>
<p>Of course you have sex in the ocean.</p>
<p>Given this set of perfect circumstances, not having sex in the ocean is madness itself.</p>
<p>The stars have not just aligned, but the entire universe. An imp-size Chris Harrison has suddenly appeared on your shoulder and rubs his tiny red horns as he whispers in your ear: &#8220;Go for it. I&#8217;ll never tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have to go for it.</p>
<p><em> Or do you?</em></p>
<h2><span style="color:#c4161c;">No, You Should Not Have Sex in the Ocean</span></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s reset the stage: Group date, cute round boats, kissing, private pool, oceanside make-out, boring other girls, late-night return to the ocean.</p>
<p>Dancing in the surf.</p>
<p>A surrender to chemistry.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p><em>But.</em></p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t he have a child at home? Isn&#8217;t the spirit of his vaunted, if frequently discarded, NO-<em>BESITO</em> rules that he wouldn&#8217;t want to do anything that might embarrass his daughter? You know, other than trying to find her a new mommy from a pool of 27 mineral coordinators/opera singers/pediatric nurses on prime-time television? The Chris Harrison on your other shoulder is busy licking his eyebrows with his adorable little forked tongue, so he&#8217;s no help.</p>
<p>And so you pause. And you consider the worst-case scenario of having sex in the ocean:</p>
<p>1. You have sex in the ocean.</p>
<p>2. The sex in the ocean is incredible.</p>
<p>3. The next day he loses his mind and tells you that it was all a huge mistake. Huh?</p>
<p>4. Because his 4-year-old daughter will watch the show and see the naughty-time that daddy had with the kissy woman in the ocean.</p>
<p>5. And somehow he blames you for it.</p>
<p>6. What a dick.</p>
<p>Holy shit! Given that set of totally unforeseeable circumstances that involve your Bachelor being an unbelievable hypocrite, even by the loosest of reality television standards, how can you possibly have sex in the ocean?</p>
<p>So: You should not have sex in the ocean. The downside is way too high. You should probably consider leaving the show, but come on, you already have a rose. You can&#8217;t just give back a rose. A rose is a valuable thing.</p>
<p>The only sane course of action is to save your first carnal exploration for the Fantasy Suite. That&#8217;s what they were made for. They are designed to be impenetrable to the gaze of even the most determined, unsupervised toddler.</p>
<p>To sum up: You definitely should not have sex in the ocean.</p>
<p><em>Or should you?</em></p>
<h2><span style="color:#c4161c;">Maybe You Should Have Sex in the Ocean?</span></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a really tricky question. Damned if we have the right answer.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll study it some more and get back to you. Tiny Chris Harrison has a fun trick he wants to show us.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100293&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Stars like Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Matt Damon, and John Goodman worked for what Clooney calls "super cheap, like crazy cheap" in order to keep the WWII art history drama within a reasonable budget.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100221&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-100279" alt="HP_getty_clooney_655" src="http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hp_getty_clooney_655.jpg?w=658"   /></p>
<p>George Clooney&#8217;s fifth directorial effort is due this weekend, and if <em>The Monuments Men</em> manages to outearn <em>The Lego Movie’</em>s debut, Cloonz should be thanking his film&#8217;s marquee faces rather than its semi-dense premise (WWII intellectuals steal European art back from the Nazis). In order to wrangle his potentially thankable friends in the first place, though, Clooney had to be lucky enough to find all those big names willing to work for one-tenth or one-15th of their usual salaries, an amount the lord of Italian lakeside celeb-retreats calls &#8220;super cheap, like crazy cheap.&#8221; And who were these &#8220;one for them, one for Clooney&#8221; types? Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Matt Damon, and<em> The Artist’</em>s Jean Dujardin.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you pay everybody a full boatload, it’s a $150 million film,&#8221; <a href="http://variety.com/2014/film/news/clooney-is-as-at-home-on-the-world-stage-as-he-is-on-the-soundstage-1201084932/" target="_blank">Clooney tells <em>Variety</em></a> in a new cover story. Taking a page from Steven Soderbergh&#8217;s <em>Ocean&#8217;s</em> book, where name-brand actors were paid about a quarter of their usual salaries, Clooney kept <em>The Monuments Men</em> below its $70 million budget. The stars will get a nice part of the back end if the movie is successful. Jonah Hill <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/01/jonah-hill-salary-wolf-of-wall-street-60000/" target="_blank">recently took a big pay hit</a> in order to work with Martin Scorsese on <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>. Hill reportedly worked for the Screen Actors Guild&#8217;s daily minimum, netting him $60,000 while Leonardo DiCaprio was said to have a $10 million contract. I don&#8217;t even know how to calculate how small of a fraction that is.</p>
<p>But wait, what was it like for Clooney to make his starriest movie yet? (OK, you wanna stump for <em>The Ides of March </em>as the starriest? That&#8217;s acceptable, too. Arguments can always be structured around films containing both the late Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ryan Gosling.) Well, one day it started snowing. &#8220;You couldn’t get fucked worse,&#8221; Clooney tells <em>Variety</em>, certainly all hunkered-down and Clooney-ish as he says it. And then those big expensive celebrities started actually helping out like they were just making a home movie with their pal George! &#8220;There’s John Goodman and Bill Murray and Matt Damon all picking up camera boxes and carrying them down this hill with the crew,&#8221; Clooney says. &#8220;Bill and John would come to the set when they weren’t even in scenes. It was really sweet.&#8221; I&#8217;m getting a strong sense that human altruism peaked with the production of <em>The Monuments Men</em>, like if I don&#8217;t see it then I don&#8217;t <em>really</em> appreciate everything Bill and John did for me or something. I mean, I&#8217;m thankful for you guys! I just really want to see those Legos jump and fly and be voiced by Morgan Freeman and Elizabeth Banks and Chris Pratt!</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;re sort of discussing why Blanchett and Damon and everyone did the movie for so cheap, can we talk about <em>why they did it for so cheap</em>? Is it because George Clooney really is as lovable and friendly with everyone in Hollywood as he seems and actors are falling over themselves to work with him even though he&#8217;s still way more of an actor than a director? (The Hill/Scorsese thing, for example, isn&#8217;t happening with any actor + George Clooney, Director.) Is it because <em>The Monuments Men</em>, which looks pretty good, has a <em>really</em> good script and is secretly going to be amazing? Or is it — CONSPIRACY THEORISTS, GATHER HERE — that <em>The Monuments Men</em> <a href="http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/george-clooneys-the-monuments-men-delayed-to-2014/" target="_blank">was <em>supposed</em> to premiere in December</a>, in the thick eggnog of awards season, and the one-tenth-scale paycheck was a justifiable trade-off since it meant a good shot at an award nomination/career booster? And if so, how do the actors feel now? Because we all know how first-quarter prestige-tinted films fare in the following year&#8217;s award season, when people are going, &#8220;<em>The &#8230;</em> the what? <em>The Monuments Men</em>? The one about &#8230; wait, what the hell was that movie, seriously? I&#8217;m voting for the Daniel Day-Lewis thing that came out on Christmas and calling it a day.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100221&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Details are frustratingly scant, but series creator/bon vivant Doug Ellin has tweeted out a photo of the first official chicken pot pie of the <em>Entourage</em> movie shoot:</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>How&#039;s that for a chicken pot pie ! <a href="http://t.co/phbs6ZaYOC" rel="nofollow">http://t.co/phbs6ZaYOC</a>&mdash; <br />Doug Ellin (@mrdougellin) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/mrdougellin/status/430419000116252672' data-datetime='2014-02-03T19:14:21+00:00'>February 03, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Questions abound: Who cooked it? (Drama?) Is it a requirement of Kevin &#8220;E&#8221; Connolly&#8217;s contract rider, to be delivered, still piping hot, to his trailer at every lunch break? Is it a set prop secretly full of cocaine because of a Vinny Chase story line? Was it an apology gift to Perrey Reeves from onscreen husband Jeremy Piven, who never learned how to spell her name correctly?</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>Great to see old friends at the Entourage table read&#8230; The one and only Perry Reeves aka Mrs. Ari <a href="http://t.co/0850gwYog8" rel="nofollow">http://t.co/0850gwYog8</a>&mdash; <br />Jeremy Piven (@jeremypiven) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/jeremypiven/status/429696960153407488' data-datetime='2014-02-01T19:25:13+00:00'>February 01, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>You know it&#039;s early when u spell your tv wife&#039;s name wrong&#8230; Sorry Perrey Reeves ( Mrs. Ari )&mdash; <br />Jeremy Piven (@jeremypiven) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/jeremypiven/status/429701688887226368' data-datetime='2014-02-01T19:44:00+00:00'>February 01, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Must the chicken pot pie be equally divided five ways, because #EntourageBoysShare?</p>
<p>There will be more chicken pot pie details as they become available. Trust that we will be monitoring the chicken pot pie situation very closely for the duration of the <em>Entourage</em> movie&#8217;s production.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=100188&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
